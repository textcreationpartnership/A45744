            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE To the READER.</head>
            <p>THE reaſon which moved the Author to publiſh theſe ſhort Characters of Moral Virtues, was a deſire he had to revive the Practice of them as much as he could, in a very degenerate Age: The World, we know, has ever had its Viciſſitudes and Periods of Virtue and Wickedneſs; and all Nations have advanced themſelves to their Power and Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, by Sobriety, Wiſdom, and a tender regard of Religion. This very Remark hath filled us with hope, that upon this our late wonderful Revolution, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation may recover its ancient Virtues, that have been too long under the Oppreſſion of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery;</hi> which hath been an Evil of ſo great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity, as to threaten ruin to the very Conſtitution of the Government: Therefore the Providence of God hath ſent us a Prince for our deliverer, whoſe Piety is ſet off with the whole Train of Moral Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues whoſe Temperance is ſo great and impregnable amidſt all thoſe Allurements, with which the Palaces of Kings are apt to meet even the moſt reſolved Minds, that at the ſame time he doth both teach and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid
<pb facs="tcp:61474:7"/>
the Court; whoſe Fortitude is more reſplendent in the Conqueſt of himſelf, than when he ſtrewes the Field with the Armies of Rebels; whoſe Gentleneſs and Mercy is ſo remarkable, that if ever the Lion and the Lamb dwelt together, it is in the Breaſt of this <hi>Royal Perſon;</hi> whoſe perſonal Virtues will in a little time render all vicious Courſes unexcuſable, and will ſhed a ſuitable Influence upon his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that not only the Honour and Plenty, but the Virtue and Goodneſs of the <hi>Engliſh People</hi> may ſpread it ſelf even to the Envy of all Neighbour Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1. Irreligion the Cauſe of Ruine to a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>But whenever men contemn the Laws of God, and are looſe in all their Converſation, they will certainly decline into Softneſs and Effeminacy; on the other ſide, when they are virtuous and upright in their Actions, they are unmoveable like a Houſe built upon a Rock; for this is the Circle of human Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs: And when Atheiſm, or a neglect of Virtue hath been at the greateſt height, as it was very lately, they have certainly brought on Changes and Diſſolutions, becauſe the Principles of Irriligion do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynt the Sinews of all Government.</p>
            <p>If this be ſo, methinks all Mankind ſhould be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to weigh and examin all the Arguments for Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, ſhould carefully enquire into the Grounds of the Chriſtian Faith, and take an account of the Truth and Credibility of the Scriptures; when they have done this, I am confident, they will think themſelves as effectually obliged in Prudence to the Duties of Virtue and Religion by the <hi>Poſſibility,</hi> as by the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of things; for whatever they pretend, it is not their Reaſon, but their Vice, that cavils at the
<pb facs="tcp:61474:7"/>
Principles of Virtue, and they except againſt it, not becauſe it contradicts their Underſtandings, but their Appetites.</p>
            <p>Now to humor or indulge theſe Appetites in all their Tranſgreſſions of the Laws of Nature and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, will appear very abſurd and unreaſonable, if we conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> That all manner of Vice is ſo vain,<note place="margin">2. Vice is a vain thing.</note> as that it cannot be forced to contribute to any wiſe End at all; Shame is the only Fruit of it, and all its Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures paſs away in a moment, leaving nothing but Sorrow and Repentance behind them. As for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Revenge is a buſie and contriving Vice, thruſts it ſelf into all the hardſhips of War, is loſt in perpetual Storms, and abandons all Peace of mind to its own impatient humour; the only Mark it aims at, is mere and abſtracted Evil; Miſchief and Bitterneſs is the fruit of all its toil. The ſame thing may be ſaid of Ambition, which is full of mighty Projects; ſtoops not to ſmall and petty Enterpriſes, but ſpends its time wholly in the queſt of Fame, and feeds upon Applauſe; <hi>vulgar</hi> Ignorance, 'tis true, hath made theſe great and glorious things; but take off the Vizard that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion hath put upon them, and what remains then but Vanity and Emptineſs? Inſomuch, that no wiſe Man would ever hazard the Eaſe of his Life in the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of vain Glory; whereas there is no Glory like that of a generous and honeſt Mind; no Applauſe like that of a Man's Conſcience for good and righteous Actions: But he, who quits the inward Joy and Content of his own Soul, for the great or the glorious things of this World, leaves a laſting Happineſs to follow a Phantaſm or a Dream: For all this, what

and follow them, as their natural, not arbitary Effects: For all Wickedneſs is its own Penance; it ever contradicts what it ſeems to aim at; if its deſign be Mirth, then it torments with Sorrow and Anguiſh; if Pride and Ambition, then it kills with Affronts and Indignities; if Luſt and Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs, then it wounds with Shame and Repentance: Thus the chiefeſt good to the voluptuous Man is Pleaſure, and if this be obtained by a ſhort and healthleſs Life, by Crudities and Inflammations, then the Man is happy; ſo all Luxury feels its Grip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and the Glutton more heartily loaths the Joys of his Sin, than he ever purſued them; his Bed or Couch is fain to give him ſome repoſe to the irkſomneſs of his Table; he dozes away his Life, and ſeems to live in a continual Lethargy; his Organs are ſo diluted with indigeſted matter, that they have not Senſe enough to perceive the briskneſs of their own Reliſhes; and if he eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape the ſudden ſtroke of a Feaver, he turns his weak and ſtokly Body into a Statue of Earth and Flegm; fills his Veins with flat and ſpiritleſs Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours; grows fat with Sloth and Dulneſs.

            <p>In all theſe Inſtances before-mentioned, Vice it deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; now it would trouble us leſs to be overborn and forced, than thus to be deluded and wheedled into De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; we may not be able to oppoſe <hi>Force;</hi> but we cannot be cozen'd, if we be but as <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>cautious</hi> as we ſhould or ought to be; that one Man is ſtronger, or richer than another, it may not be in our power to help; but if a Man be not as prudent or vertuous as another, it may be much his own fault, for this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon his own care, and the improvement of thoſe Faculties, which God hath given him; and I am of Opinion, that we ſhould be wiſe enough for one another, if we were but <hi>equally honeſt;</hi> and if Men would conſider the doleful iſſues of Impiety, it would be eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

Nay, if they would but think, what kind of Creatures God hath made them, they muſt look upon Vice as the greateſt Corruption and Diſhonor to their Natures; for they are placed in a middle State be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Brutes;</hi> they are made up of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Principles, <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> are endued with contrary Faculties, <hi>animal</hi> and <hi>rational;</hi> this is their Condition, and by this means they are in a Capacity to exerciſe the <hi>Virtues</hi> peculiar to their compounded Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; for the Life of Man in this World is nothing elſe but an <hi>Olympick</hi> Exerciſe; therefore it is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in the Scripture as a Race, a Warfare, a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring in the Vineyard; the great Principles and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Chriſtian Life can be exerciſed only, while we have bodily Appetites and Paſſions to govern, that ſolicite and tempt us to ſenſual Exceſſes: Herein there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conſiſts the true Gallantry of Spirit, when it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouls all thoſe lower Powers that ought to obey Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, when it defends the Authority thereof againſt all the rebellious Attempts of Paſſion and Concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence. For unleſs our Souls had been lodged in Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies full of unreaſonable Inclinations, they would not

<pb facs="tcp:61474:16"/>
they are wilfully or careleſly unreaſonable, eſpecially when the Rules and Directions of Religion are all ſober and practicable; when it doth not flatter Men with Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantick degrees of Happineſs upon fond and fantaſtick Principles, but complies with the Conditions of Human Life; for we have no high-ſtrain'd Paradoxes, ſuch as the <hi>Stolcks</hi> had againſt the Convictions of Senſe and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience; but we are allowed to eſteem of every thing, as <hi>we find</hi> and <hi>feel it;</hi> above all we are charged to purge our Minds of froward Humors, and to ſweeten them with mild Principles; to moderate and command our Paſſions, and in all Circumſtances to govern our ſelves by the Laws of Wiſdom and Moderation: with which when the Mind is furniſhed; it is able to extract ſomething beneficial to its own Intereſts from the moſt malicious Accidents, and may be Serene in the midſt of Storms, Contented in the midſt of Diſappointments: But ſuppoſe there were nothing in Virtue, but Hardſhips and Difficulties, a perpetual Force and Violence to Nature, a conſtant War with the World and the Fleſh; cannot we endure all this for an endleſs Reward? for we muſt have a very mean Opinion of Heaven, if we do not think it worth the Obedience and Service of a few years, how difficult ſoever that were: for the Expectation of a future Happineſs hath been that Principle, from whence that Confidence and Courage hath ariſen, whereby vertuous Perſons have been ſupported in their Sufferings for that which is good.</p>
            <p>But beſides the future Reward that doth await them, the Lovers of Virtue are the happieſt Men upon Earth for theſe two Reaſons;</p>

The world is kept up by Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Men.</note> and ſink under the weight of its own Wickedneſs, did not virtuous Men put in their Shoulders to uphold the Fabrick: <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> indeed is very inquiſitive how Human Societies were kept up, and affirms the Cauſe, why they did not disband and run into Confuſion, to be the mutual Vices and Wickedneſſes of Men; one Ambitious Man oppoſing an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and checking him in his Deſigns; one Knave diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering another; one Cruel Man keeping another in awe; And the Politicians think, that the World is ſuſtained by their little Arts and Devices in Government; But theſe are but like <hi>Anticks</hi> in a Building, that ſeem to crouch and bend under the weight of it, as if they bore it up, when they do nothing leſs, but have as much need of being prop'd up themſelves, as any other part of the Structure: 'Tis not the <hi>Wiſe,</hi> the <hi>Noble,</hi> and <hi>the Strong,</hi> that are ſufficient Pillars to bear up the World; but the weak things, the holy, righteous, and good Man, upon whom the whole ſtreſs and weight of it lies: For wicked Men, be they never ſo high and great, are but rotten Supporters; they are ſo far from contributing to its Preſervation, that they are continually ſoliciting God's Judgments, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down his Vengeance upon the Earth: Thus the corrupt Converſation of the Men of <hi>Sodom</hi> was the Vapor that did aſcend to Heaven, and gather into a Cloud of Wrath, which did for a long time hang over thoſe Cities; And Righteous <hi>Lot</hi> only hinder'd its being poured out upon them, and when he was removed, they fell into Deſolation as in a Moment.</p>
            <p>So the Places where Virtuous Men dwell, are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched with many Bleſſings for their ſakes, and the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb facs="tcp:61474:17"/>
with whom they converſe, are happy as it were by <hi>Concomitancy;</hi> they enjoy much Proſperity, and are freed from many Evils, by reaſon of their Neighbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood to good Men; <hi>for the Pſalmiſt hath told us, that God bleſſeth the habitation of the righteous, nor ſhall any plague come nigh his dwelling:</hi> Thus the Lord was with <hi>Jacob</hi> and proſpered <hi>Laban</hi> for his ſake; and He was with <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and bleſſed the <hi>Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi>'s Houſe for his. For the World muſt needs be the better for ſuch, as are ever ready to relieve thoſe that are in Want; to feed an Enemy if he be hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry; to give Drink to the Thirſty; to pity the Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, to bind up the Wounds of the Lame, and to cloath the Naked; to do any Man a Kindneſs and reconcile all Differences: And if a Virtuous Man, be in a more publick Capacity, then the Effects of his Goodneſs will be more large and diffuſive: He will be of a more publick benefit and advantage: And we muſt take notice, that nothing doth conduce more to the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the World, than the bettering Mens manners; now this Virtuous Men do theſe two ways:

               <note place="margin">(14.) The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Mankind is made better by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of good Men.</note>Their Lips preſerve the ſoundeſt Knowledg, and they are ever inſtructing others in the ways, they take them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; hence they are called the Lights of the Earth, that enlighten all about them; for they are ever diſtill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wiſe Advices; which, however they may at firſt ſeem grievous, yet they inſinuate by degrees, and get poſſeſſion of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding; they are frequently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakening thoſe, with whom they diſcourſe, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of God's Goodneſs, the Eternity of their own Souls; putting them upon the beſt improvement of their time, exciting them to the Love of God and of their
<pb facs="tcp:61474:17"/>
Neighbour, taking all wiſe occaſions to reprove the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of Men, and to reſtrain their exorbitant Courſes: So their Example is of great force to amend their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, becauſe it is a greater encouragement to go before a Man, and ſhew him the Path of Virtue, than only to give him direction; 'tis true, Religion and Virtue are more lovely in the notion and definition of them, than they are in the Perſon; in the definition they are pure, and have nothing of Allay; but in the Perſon they are attended with mixture and imperfection; yet Virtue is more lively in the Perſon; and they ſay, that a Man, who ſhoots, can better take his aim at a living than a dead Mark, becauſe there is ſomething in Life, that commands a more ſteddy attention, and makes us look more intently upon it; tho Religion and Virtue may he repreſented with more Advantage in a Diſcourſe; and a Man may be better convinced that way of their Excellency; yet Example ſatisfies one of the practicableneſs of the thing: For Holineſs would appear an impoſſible thing, and not to be attained, were it not, that we have it made familiar to us, and eaſie for our imitation in the Lives of virtuous Men; who by their Counſel and Inſtruction, point out the way of Virtue to us; but by their Example, they take us by the hand, and lead us in that way: And it is incredible, of what Advantage a few great Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples may be to reform the World; chiefly if their places have given them any advantage of ground, and do make them ſubject to the notice of others; thus the Example of <hi>Socrates</hi> had an influence upon <hi>Athens,</hi> and the ſevere Life of <hi>Cato</hi> upon the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Rome.</hi> 'Tis true indeed, the Nature of Man leaneth to evil, and is inſenſibly drawn away by bad
<pb facs="tcp:61474:18"/>
Examples; yet it is not ſo degenerate, but it may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſome Impreſſions of Virtue, from the Lives, Company, and Converſation of good Men, who in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Counſel and Inſtruction, are the Lights of the World; ſo in reſpect of their Example, they are the Salt of the Earth; for a Man of ſevere Innocency and Juſtice, is as ſo much Salt caſt into the World to preſerve the Manners of Men from Putrefaction; a Man of a gentle and converſable Temper, of a peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and reconciling Mind, is like ſo much Balm to heal the Wounds and Exaſperations of Mens Spirits; a Man of a ſtrict Piety and lively Devotion, of an ardent Zeal and active Induſtry for Goodneſs, is as ſo much Fire or Life ſent down from Heaven, to awaken the drowſie Worlds, and rowze the endeavours of others after the beſt things; a Man of eminent Holineſs doth diſcourage the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodlineſs of Men; and one of a wiſe and grave Behaviour doth reſtrain their Vanity and Folly. Thus the Preſervation and the Bettering of the World, muſt be aſcribed to virtuous Perſons, as an Effect, and as a Reward of their Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; for they are ever perſuading Men to be better, and they keep 'em from growing worſe; and God doth not only reward them in their Perſons, but all, who are near or related to them, ſhall thrive the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for their ſakes; thus the eminent Faith of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and the Sincerity of <hi>David,</hi> had an influence upon the Happineſs of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for many Generations.</p>
            <p>Therefore if we would avoid being impoſed upon, and would take juſt Meaſures of our ſelves, we are to judg of our Condition, as the Pſalmiſt directs, <hi>Pſal. 18.21.</hi> according as we have <hi>kept the ways of the Lord, and have not wickedly departed from
<pb facs="tcp:61474:18"/>
God:</hi> For the beſt proof the Schools afford, is a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration by the Effect; as for inſtance, if you are to prove the Being of a God, the beſt way to do it, is from what he hath made; ſo the beſt Method for a Man to prove himſelf to be virtuous, is from what he does. Thus our Saviour hath told us, <hi>a good tree bringeth forth good fruit, and an evil one evil fruit:</hi> Now it is a Matter of great conſequence to know, whether we be in a ſtate of Salvation or not; we are apt to puzzle our ſelves with obſcure Marks of Grace and doubtful Signs of our good State; but there is one plain and ſenſible Mark, which will ſilence all Jealouſies, and that is the keeping of God's Commandments; this we may come at without ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the Records of Heaven, or diving into the ſecret Counſels of God. Perhaps there is nothing in Religion more to be wondered at, than to ſee ſo many Chriſtians in continual Anxieties about their State, and ſo few, that can arrive to any competent degree of aſſurance in this matter: Whereas the Scripture every where nakedly declares to Men their Duty, and has plainly laid down the Precepts of a holy Life, and all along ſuppoſes, that by Obedience to theſe, Men may certainly know whether they love God or not; that by giving all <hi>diligence to abound</hi> in Grace and the <hi>Virtues</hi> of a holy Life, they <hi>may make their Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Election ſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For there are two different States of Men;<note place="margin">(15.) There are two diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent States of Men.</note> one is, wherein Sin prevails; in the other Religion and Goodneſs take place; theſe two differ in degrees, as wide as Heaven and Hell; which Places we muſt not believe to be all hereafter; for both the one and the other are in ſome meaſure begun here upon Earth.

They who are made like to God in the frame and temper of their Minds; who live according to the everlaſting and unchangeable Rules of Goodneſs, Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs and Truth, may be properly enough ſaid to have made their entrance already into Heaven. But they who confound the difference of good and evil; who care not to approve themſelves to God, by leading good and holy Lives, do partake of the diabolical Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and are already entred into the ſtate of Hell: Wherefore it behoves us to keep the <hi>ways of the Lord</hi> with Diligence and Care, which the Judgment of right and wrong, true and falſe, good and evil, doth require: For this is the <hi>very Grammar of Religion,</hi> and being built upon theſe firſt Principles, it grows higher by degrees, according to every ones Capacity and Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in moderating his Faculties for the ſeveral pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of it. Now the firſt thing in Religion, is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine a Man's Temper; and the ſecond is, to govern his Practice; for if it do not mend Mens Spirits and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate their Lives, it is much inferiour to any Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in Nature, which is ſufficient to, and doth at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain its effect. But the Grace of God ſuperadded to the reaſon of our Minds, is of ſtrength ſufficient to ſubdue all the Temptations to evil; if the Creation below us, by natural inſtinct, doth thoſe things that are regular, ſhall not theſe higher Principles do the like, always preſerve us from known evil, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine us to that which is <hi>morally good?</hi> This is the courſe of things in Nature; every Habit begun is greatly weakened by a forbearance of Acts; for every thing muſt be kept up in the way, it was produced; a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is firſt wrought by ſome Acts, and if Act be not continued upon Act, the Diſpoſition will fail; for things
<pb facs="tcp:61474:19"/>
that are not brought to a State of Perfection, will go back again, if they be not maintained in the ſame way that they were produced: Wherefore it will be worth the while to enquire what our moſt holy Religion aims at, and after what manner it doth affect the Perſon in whom it is lodged.</p>
            <p>Now Religion makes us live up to our higheſt Faculties, and teaches us to practiſe ſuch Virtues as become rational Beings, who bear the Image of the Immortal God, and are exalted above the Inferior Creation; prompts us to ſcorn all Actions that are baſe, unhanſom, or unworthy our State and Relation in which we ſtand to our Creator, forbids us to do any thing that will make us like Beaſts, or that would ſink us into a lower order by Senſuality and Carnal-mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, or that would transform us into the likeneſs of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, by Pride, Preſumption, and Self conceit; makes us God-like in Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Goodneſs, Charity, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion; in forgiving Injuries, pardoning Enemies, and in doing hurt to none, but good to all, as we have power and opportunity; adviſes us to follow the conduct of true and ſincere Reaſon, tames the Extravagancy of our Paſſions, and regulates the Exorbitances of the Will, permits us the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of our Bodies ſo far as they may give no diſturbance to the Mind, produces a ſweet and gracious Temper of Soul, calm in it ſelf and loving to Mankind; begets in us free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Spirit, and baniſhes groundleſs Fears, fooliſh Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, and daſtardly Thoughts; teaches us to have right Conceptions of God, that he doth tranſact all things with Mankind, as a loving Father with his Children; creates in us a rational Satisfaction, and the joy of a good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, advances the Soul to its juſt Sovereignty over inferior Appetites, which would diſable it for all good and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Acts, and render us weak fooliſh, and unfit for any thing that is generous or noble; ſtrengthens our Reaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

the Onſets of the World, Fleſh and Devil, which is effected chiefly by ſtifling all manner of Intemperance; for it is this that fruſtrates the Work of Religion, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by ſtupifying or imaging the Spirits, or by putting them into irregular Motions.</p>

            <p>For Holineſs hath ſomething of God in it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt needs be a victorious and triumphant thing.

            <p>And from the Deſires we have of a true Reformation, which muſt be begun in our own Hearts and Lives; for all <hi>outward Forms and Models</hi> thereof are of little worth without the <hi>inward Amendment</hi> of our own Souls: For the baſer Metals are not changed by their being caſt into a good Mold, or by being made up in an elegant Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure; neither will adulterate Silver paſs, when the Touch-ſtone tryes it; neither can we be <hi>reformed,</hi> before the Corruptions of our Hearts are purged away: And when this once comes to paſs, then ſhall <hi>Chriſt be ſet upon his Throne,</hi> then the Glory of the <hi>Lord ſhall overflow the Land,</hi> then we ſhall be a People <hi>acceptable</hi> to him, and <hi>as Mount Sion,</hi> which he dearly loved, then by Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction we ſhall ſee our ſelves as in a Glaſs, and our Faults being diſcovered, we ſhall readily endeavour to amend them; for it is not in this caſe, as in bodily Diſtempers, when the Body is neceſſitated by connexion of Cauſes to ſuffer the Malady upon it;<note place="margin">Every man is obliged to reform himſelf.</note> but the Soul it in its own power; the firſt ſtep therefore to a Cure, is for a Man to convince himſelf by his own Reaſon, that he hath done evil, and the deſire to have this Diſeaſe removed naturally follows there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon: For it is to no purpoſe to complain of bad Times, or to expect better days, ſo long as Mankind are ſo averſe from cleanſing their own Hearts: Whereas if the Motions and Inclinations of the Soul within were once ſet right, all
<pb facs="tcp:61474:21"/>
things without will go true, becauſe they are all moved by thoſe hidden Springs; and if every Man would ſtudy to do his own buſineſs in the ways of a virtuous and good Life, all Commotions in the Earth and all Differences would preſently ceaſe. And <hi>Solomon</hi> makes this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion from all thoſe wiſe Reflections he made upon things under the Sun, <hi>Fear God and keep his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi> for this is a Man's whole buſineſs, and his whole Excellency: So that there is nothing in Religion that I have wondered at more,<note place="margin">The beſt way to know what our Condition is, muſt be from keeping God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> than to ſee many Chriſtians in continual Anxieties about their State, complaining much of their want of aſſurance in this matter, when it may be brought to a ſpeedy and plain iſſue, by examining our ſelves, how we have kept God's Commandments, the moral Precepts of an holy Life; this one Mark of our Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity in Religion well attended to, would ſilence all thoſe Suſpicions, that many Perſons are apt to entertain concerning their Condition: If it were worth our while to enquire into the reaſon of theſe Doubts and Fears, they may be truly reſolved into a dark and melancholy Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, or into falſe Conceptions of God, and his Affection towards Men, or into the Breaches and inequality of our Obedience to his Laws. Now the melancholy temper muſt be left to <hi>Phyſick and Time;</hi> for the Scripture preſcribes nothing at all in this Caſe, any more than it does for a <hi>Frenzy</hi> or <hi>Feaver;</hi> but that is a very falſe and danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Principle, which ſome have entertained concerning God, as if he did notreally deſire the Happineſs of Man, but watched all Advantages to ſurprize him into Deſtruction; as if his goodneſs was not a ſetled and conſtant Diſpoſition of his Nature, but took him <hi>at certain Fits,</hi> as it does the Sons of Men; as if we could have no ſure Rule to know, when we might hope for his Favor, as if the Majeſty of
<pb facs="tcp:61474:22"/>
Heaven were merely arbitrary in diſpenſing of things as he pleaſes, without conſidering any Qualification in his Creatures: Whereas he, who will not believe there is ſo much goodneſs in God, as that he did not make us for our own Ruin, can never have any quiet in his Mind, becauſe nothing but the goodneſs of God can be a reaſonable ground of Hope or Security to him.<note place="margin">Many Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs ariſe from falſe Notions of God and Religion.</note> The next Miſchief to this doth ariſe from falſe Notions concerning Religion, as if it did wholly conſiſt in the performance of external Duties; now we muſt not take the Meaſures of our Religion by the ebbings and flowings of our Spirits, that depend upon our natural Temper, but by a firm Reſolution of Soul to keep God's Commandments, by the conformity of our Wills to his,<note place="margin">Another Miſchief proceeds from the frequent Interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a holy Life.</note> and by the conſtancy of our Obedience to his Laws: Another Miſchief proceeds from the frequent Interruptions and great Breaches of a holy Life; and this doth much diſquiet the Spirits of Men, ſo that uſually they betake themſelves to falſe Principles for relief: Whereas that Perſon, who rightly underſtands the Nature of God, who hath worthy apprehenſions about his Goodneſs to Mankind, hath true Notions about Religion, and is free from any melancholy Diſtemper; who doth for the moſt part conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in an even courſe of Obedience, allowing for human Frailties, that befal the beſt of Men; he enjoys a laſting Peace and Serenity of Mind, without any conſiderable Change, but ſuch as he can give an account of from his ſenſible Failings and Variations. For I do not believe, that Comfort and Peace of Conſcience are ſuch arbitrary things, as that God gives them to <hi>whom and when he pleaſes,</hi> without any regard of our Carriage towards him; but God hath ſo ordered Matters, that Peace and Comfort ſhall be the natural reſult of our Duty, and the diſcharge of a good Conſcience towards God and towards man.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:61474:22"/>The truth is, we do not live according to thoſe Rules of Righteouſneſs, that are laid down in his Goſpel for the Government of our Lives, and ſo we are affraid to try our ſelves by this Evidence of our Love to God, our <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his Commands;</hi> but are glad to hearken to any other obſcure ſigns, which we cannot be certain of, neither will they bring the buſineſs to any iſſue; like a Man that hath outrun himſelf in his Eſtate, he is unwilling to look <hi>into his Books,</hi> but had rather feed himſelf with ſome uncertain ſigns of his good Condition, than examin his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, that he may truly know what it is.</p>
            <p>If we would not deceive our own Souls, we muſt bring our ſelves to this touchſtone, <hi>Obedience to all the Laws of God,</hi> by this means we ſhall take a certain courſe to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, <hi>what ſtate we are in;</hi> which Laws we are ſufficiently enabled to keep by that Grace and Aſſiſtance that God offers, and is never denied to thoſe that are not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to themſelves: And Man being the only Creature in this viſible World, that is formed with a Capacity of Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Enjoying his Maker, we have no juſt pretence to Reaſon,<note place="margin">The beſt way to know what our Condition is, muſt be from keeping God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> unleſs our Reaſon be determined to actions of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: For as Men, we are endowed with ſuch a Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as is capable of apprehending a Deity, and of expecting a future State after this Life; whence it follows, that our proper Happineſs muſt conſiſt in the perfecting of this Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; which nothing elſe but Religion can ſo much as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to: it is true indeed, <hi>Health, Riches, Reputation, Safety,</hi> are neceſſary to render our Condition pleaſant and comfortable in this World: Now herein appears the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of Religion, that it is not only the <hi>Moral</hi> but the <hi>Natural</hi> Cauſe of all theſe things, becauſe it doth not only entitle us to an Eternal Reward from a Juſt and Wiſe Providence, but by a <hi>Phyſical Efficacy</hi> it procures for us
<pb facs="tcp:61474:23"/>
each of thoſe things, wherein our Temporal Happineſs doth conſiſt: Inſomuch that if we could ſuppoſe our ſelves in a capacity of capitulating with God concerning the Terms, upon which we would ſubmit to his Government, and were we to chuſe the Laws we would be bound to obſerve, it were not poſſible for us to make any Propoſals, which upon all accounts ſhould be more for our Intereſt, than thoſe very Conditions to which we are obliged by the Rules of Virtue and Religion: For were theſe and the fear of a God wholly extinguiſhed, there would follow ſuch wild Extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies amongſt Men,<note place="margin">Without Religion all things would be in diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</note> as would not leave ſo much as the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow or face of common honeſty and order in the World; there being no kind of Vice, which Men would not abandon themſelves unto, conſidering how impetuous their natural Appetites are, and the power of Temptations.</p>
            <p>Rituals indeed, and external Obſervations of Religion are readily complied with, and Men without much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty are brought to them, becauſe they may be conſiſtent with their Luſts; but they are impatient of practical Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, becauſe they fetter their Inclinations to Sin; this is a Yoke that galls their Necks; a burden too heavy for them to bear.</p>
            <p>Hence it hath been taken notice of, that there is no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in the World, either <hi>Jewiſh, Turkiſh,</hi> or <hi>Pagan,</hi> ſo careleſly obſerved by its Proſelytes, as <hi>ours</hi> is, whereof this muſt be aſſigned the Cauſe; their Inſtitutions are for the moſt part Schemes of <hi>Ceremony</hi> and <hi>Bodily Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;</hi> whereas univerſal Goodneſs and Virtue are the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſible Injunctions of <hi>Chriſtianity:</hi> Now to abſtain from all appearance of Evil, and to keep our ſelves unſpotted from the World, goes againſt the Grain, lays <hi>the Axe</hi> to <hi>the root of the Tree,</hi> and <hi>flays</hi> the <hi>Aethiopian, while he is alive:</hi> And <hi>Diogenes Laertius</hi> gives this Reaſon, why
<pb facs="tcp:61474:23"/>
the <hi>Epicureans</hi> kept cloſer to their Rule than the <hi>Stoicks</hi> did, becauſe the firſt enjoined only what <hi>Men had a mind to be,</hi> but the later, <hi>what they ought to be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what Chriſtians ought to be, our Religion teaches,<note place="margin">Why we ought to be ſerious in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Religion.</note> let us therefore be ſerious in the practice of it, for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon among many others, becauſe <hi>when a few days are paſt, we muſt all of us go to the place, whence we ſhall not return;</hi> and when we come to dye, nothing then will be of advantage to us, but the <hi>Teſtimony of our Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,</hi> that <hi>in ſimplicity</hi> and <hi>Godly ſincerity, we have had our Converſation in this World;</hi> upon which we may confidently expect, that there is laid up for us <hi>a Crown of Righteouſneſs,</hi> which the Lord the Righteous Judge will give unto us at the day of his appearance, when <hi>He ſhall come to bring every work</hi> to <hi>judgment,</hi> with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſecret thing, <hi>whether it be good, or whether it be evil.</hi>

            <head>Of the NATURE of ETHICKS.</head>
            <p>THIS is the <hi>peculiar</hi> End and Uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> to eſtabliſh <hi>real</hi> Virtue in the World: And in the Primitive Ages of Chriſtianity, the Virtues of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Meekneſs, Patience,</hi> and <hi>Humility,</hi> were eſteemed the diſtinguiſhing Graces of the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> in that time the <hi>plain,</hi> the <hi>humble,</hi> and the <hi>downright</hi> Chriſtian was never diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed as a mere <hi>Moraliſt.</hi> The firſt Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers taught Men to purchaſe the Hopes of Salvation by <hi>living up</hi> to the <hi>ſevereſt</hi> and moſt <hi>exalted</hi> Doctrines of their Faith; then to be <hi>reformed,</hi> was without any more ado to be <hi>regenerate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Doctrine therefore of <hi>Ethicks</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the principal Part or End of <hi>Human Life;</hi>
               <note place="margin">An enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry after the End of human Actions.</note> which tho it is not to be had under the Sun, where nothing either good or bad hath any long <hi>Duration;</hi> yet <hi>ſomething</hi> we muſt aim at and lay hold on, in the <hi>due culture</hi> whereof we may place our greateſt <hi>Eaſe</hi> and <hi>Happineſs.</hi> This thing, whatever
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61474:25"/>
it is, muſt neceſſarily include theſe three <hi>Conditions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, IT muſt be <hi>agreeable</hi> and <hi>proper</hi> to <hi>Humane Nature;</hi> for that we ſeek for, muſt be moſt <hi>excellent;</hi> and what Excellency can be in that, whereof <hi>ſenſleſs</hi> and <hi>brute</hi> Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do partake equally with our ſelves?</p>
            <p>Secondly, IT muſt give us <hi>full Content;</hi> for ſo long as we deſire ſomewhat more, it is not poſſible, that the Heart ſhould reſt ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, IT muſt be within <hi>our power</hi> to get it, if we pleaſe; for what ſatisfaction or happineſs can be in that from which we may be <hi>hindered,</hi> either in the <hi>attaining</hi> or <hi>continuing</hi> it?</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Moral Virtue hath all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note>HE, who in his ſearch for <hi>Happineſs</hi> can find any thing wherein theſe Properties <hi>meet,</hi> ſhould ſo highly value that Treaſure, as to ſell all to purchaſe the Field where it is. In the mean time, till ſomething better be brought to light, we will be contented to take <hi>Moral Virtue</hi> into our conſideration, and ſee whether theſe <hi>three Properties</hi> are to be found in her. But before we do this, it is fit we ſhould conſider ſome great Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes of the <hi>old Philoſophers</hi> about this matter; one was, That they would have their Chiefeſt Good in <hi>this Life;</hi> another
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61474:25"/>
was, They would have it ſo in their <hi>own power,</hi> and within <hi>themſelves,</hi> that neither God nor man ſhould be able to hinder them of it.<note place="margin">The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micks and Stoicks.</note> Herein lay the fundamental Difference between the Morality of the <hi>Academicks</hi> and <hi>Stoicks.</hi> The courſe the <hi>Platoniſts</hi> took, was to <hi>purge</hi> their Minds of <hi>froward Humors,</hi> to moderate their <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,</hi> to furniſh themſelves with <hi>Prudence,</hi> and then whatever happen'd, to govern themſelves by the Laws of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Moderation;</hi> becauſe when the Mind is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with theſe Virtues, it is able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract ſomething <hi>beneficial</hi> to its own Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts, from the moſt <hi>malicious Accidents.</hi> The <hi>Stoicks</hi> fooliſhly thought, that we ſhould be diſquieted with perpetual <hi>Fears,</hi> if our Happineſs were not wholly lodged within our <hi>own Breaſts:</hi> Whereas a wiſe and good Man, that conſiders the <hi>uncertainty</hi> of things, will neither be ſo ſtupid, as to be <hi>ſurpriz'd</hi> with any Diſaſter, nor ſo ſilly, as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe it by a <hi>fruitleſs Anxiety,</hi> but will make the beſt of his Condition, by a <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet</hi> management of himſelf and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
            <p>NOW <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that great Maſter of <hi>Ethicks,</hi> in his inquiſition after the <hi>Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> of <hi>Moral Virtue,</hi> firſt falls upon the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61474:26"/>
conſideration of <hi>Good,</hi> what it is, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines it to be, That which all our Deſires aim at; and indeed, what can ſatisfie our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, but that which is <hi>good;</hi> for even <hi>evil</hi> things, when they are ſought after, <hi>appear</hi> unto us under the ſhew of <hi>good:</hi> Whence comes that common diſtinction of <hi>Bonum apparens &amp; verum Bonum; Bonum ſenſui &amp; Bonum rationi.</hi> From this general deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what is good, he comes in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular to conſider of <hi>Bonum Homini:</hi> And ſeeing there are many things which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>profitable</hi> and <hi>good</hi> for Man, he makes yet a more particular Enquiry, whether there be not ſome <hi>one thing,</hi> wherein eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man places the End of all his Deſires.</p>
            <p>'TIS true, that <hi>every</hi> Man propoſeth to himſelf <hi>ſomewhat,</hi> which if he could once arrive at, he would think himſelf a happy Perſon.<note place="margin">The Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers divided in their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions about the Chiefeſt Good.</note> One ſeeketh <hi>Pleaſure</hi> and <hi>Eaſe,</hi> as <hi>Ariſtippus</hi> and the <hi>Cyrenaicks</hi> did; a ſecond would have <hi>Indolence,</hi> or a <hi>freedom</hi> from all <hi>Trouble,</hi> which the <hi>Epicureans</hi> wiſhed for; another perhaps prefers a ſort of <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> without <hi>Senſe,</hi> like that of the <hi>Stoicks;</hi> One fixes his Mind upon <hi>Wealth</hi> and <hi>Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance;</hi> another upon <hi>Honor</hi> and <hi>State;</hi> and a third ſhall purſue with all his <hi>might</hi> ſome <hi>particular Courſe</hi> of Life, as a <hi>Trade,</hi> or any
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61474:26"/>
way of <hi>Buſineſs;</hi> which if he could bring to any perfection, he ſuppoſes he ſhould have his <hi>Deſires</hi> fully anſwered. A mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Fancies there are of this kind, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as many as there are <hi>Complexions</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Men, wherein Mankind have been uſed to lodge their final <hi>Good,</hi> or the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſcope of their <hi>Wiſhes.</hi> It will not therefore be amiſs to enquire, <hi>what</hi> this is, and whether it be poſſible to <hi>find</hi> that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter out, which would be adequate to all our Deſires.</p>
            <p>And Firſt, IT may well be <hi>doubted,</hi> ſince no Man was ever yet known to <hi>poſſeſs</hi> on Earth, that thing which could <hi>fully</hi> ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, IF we ſuppoſe any Man to have <hi>had</hi> it, yet the very Anxiety and Fear of <hi>loſing</hi> it, would abate much of the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure he might take in the Enjoyment of it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, THE unavoidable expectation of <hi>Death</hi> were enough to draw off all our Inclinations after this World, ſince that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Death, <hi>Nature</hi> affords us <hi>no Proſpect</hi> or <hi>Certainty</hi> of any thing, wherein we may place our laſt <hi>Eaſe</hi> and <hi>Contentment:</hi> So that the enquiry, <hi>What</hi> it is which would final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>content</hi> us, is likely to prove no other, than that vain phantaſtical Labour which
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61474:27"/>
many Men to their utter ruine have taken in purſuit of the <hi>Philoſopher's Stone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOTWITHSTANDING all this, we muſt find out ſomething, which we may truly call our <hi>final Good:</hi> For that reſtleſs Deſire after it, which is generally in all Men, cannot be to no purpoſe, ſince God and Nature never made any thing in <hi>vain,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it conſiſtent with his <hi>Juſtice</hi> or <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> to put any Creature upon a continual Rack; the contrary to which were una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably true, if under the Sun there were nothing, which might anſwer this <hi>univerſal Appetite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

            <p>HAVING ſought after <hi>Felicity</hi> where it <hi>is not,</hi> it remains that we ſearch for it where it <hi>is;</hi> otherwiſe the moſt <hi>natural</hi> and moſt <hi>ſincere</hi> of all our Deſires would be <hi>falſe</hi> and <hi>unprofitable.</hi> Some define it to be <hi>ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum Bonum;</hi> others <hi>Bonum hominis maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mè expetendum;</hi> ſome that it's <hi>Bonum homini per ſe ſufficiens;</hi> that which is able alone to ſatisfie all our Deſires.

            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:61474:36"/>NOW all the Paſſions of the ſenſitive Soul are apt to offend in being either too much, or too little, and the prudent choice of juſt what is enough, is the chief work of Virtue.

            <p>To do which one thing, a virtuous Man muſt have the <hi>perfect</hi> uſe of his <hi>Reaſon:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Why Youth are not fit Hearers of Moral Philoſophy</note> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account ſome Philoſophers have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputed, whether <hi>young</hi> Perſons ſhould hear or read their Leſſons, and have determined, they ſhould not: And <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſets it down
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61474:37"/>
for a Maxim, that <hi>Youth</hi> are not fit Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Moral Philoſophy. For the fickle<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſs of their Fancy, the unrulineſs of their Paſſions, the wild Sallies of their Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſuffer 'em not to reap any benefit by virtuous Diſcipline or Education: But when <hi>Age</hi> hath ſomewhat cool'd the Heats of Paſſion; when Wiſdom and Experience hath cured all the Boylings of their Blood, and hath maſter'd every exorbitant Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour: Then is the proper time to cultivate the Soil, and ſow the Seeds of Vertue.</p>
            <p>HOWSOEVER it be with this part of <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Doctrin, yet by the method he preſcribes, the Hearer of Moral Precepts muſt have ſuch a ſhare of <hi>Prudence,</hi> as may render him able to chooſe ſo much Paſſion, as is due unto the Action which he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes.</p>
            <p>HOW this Choice can be made by <hi>Youth,</hi> unleſs they be firſt well diſciplined, is more than <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath taught us: For making all Virtue to flow from <hi>Prudence;</hi> he allotts no time to learn <hi>Wit,</hi> which muſt be wrought in us by chance or ſome good fortune: For <hi>Prudence</hi> being a ſolid and conſtant Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, and all Habits being gotten by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of frequent Acts, ſome ſpace of time there muſt be in which theſe Acts, that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61474:37"/>
produce our Habits, muſt be practiſed. Now whether Age or Youth be the fitter ſeaſon to plant Virtue in the mind, let thoſe make it a queſtion who are ignorant, whether the <hi>Spring</hi> or <hi>Autumn</hi> be the better Seed-time.</p>
            <p>SEEING that the ſowing of this good Seed doth bring forth the beſt and the greateſt Men; thoſe, who are moſt ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to God, and thoſe that are moſt uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the World: it will be worth our while to conſider what that time of our Life is in which the Principles of Virtue ought to be imbibed: In order to a more cloſe enquiry into this matter, we will firſt ſee, what the natural ſtate of the youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Age is; ſecondly, we will prove it to be the beſt and moſt proper time to learn the great Art of living well.</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">A Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of the Youthful Age.</note> YOUNG Men are violent in their Deſires, and ever eager to execute them; they have by natural Heat that diſpoſition, which elder Ages have by <hi>Wine;</hi> Youth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>kind</hi> of Natural <hi>Drunkenneſs;</hi> they eaſily forſake, what they have much long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, being very inconſtant, and they love Honour or Succeſs, more than Mony, as having not been yet in want; they are good-natur'd, becauſe they have not been
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61474:38"/>
acquainted with much malice, and they are credulous, becauſe they have not yet been often deceived; they are ſtout for that they have not yet been caſt down by the Mifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of Human Life, and on all occaſions are apt to err in the exceſs, rather than in the Defect, becauſe they overdo every thing.</p>
            <p>THIS being the natural State of our youthful Age, in the next place we will conſider, whether this be the beſt time to learn Virtue in. Now, in my Opinion, to plant the Principles of Virtue in the firſt Age of our lives, is the ſame thing as to build a Houſe upon a Rock: No Storms nor Winds ſhall ſhake it; it being in Civil as it is in Natural Plantations; where young tender trees, though ſubject to the injuries of the Air, and in danger even of their own flexibility, would yet little want any Underproppings, if they were at firſt well faſtned in their Roots: 'Tis true, at this time the mind is moſt in danger of being miſled by Fancies, and of being diſturbed by Paſſions, which are the various motions thereof to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Objects agreeable or diſagreeable: But theſe and the Inclinations too which are only the more frequent exerciſe of the Paſſions, are all made obedient to ſound
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61474:38"/>
Reaſon and moſt tenacious of the rules of Vertue, if they are received betimes.</p>
            <p>FOR before the Veſſel be ſeaſoned with one kind of Liquor it is equally capable of all,<note place="margin">Reaſons, Why Youth is the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt time to learn Virtue.</note> and ſo the Wax is indifferent to any impreſſion, before it is moulded and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by a particular Seal: If the mind be <hi>raſa Tabula,</hi> as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> would have it, then this White Paper may beſt be inriched with good Inſcriptions, before it be ſoiled or blotted with evil: Or if there be any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, connatural Notions, which the <hi>Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> affirm, it is beſt then to awaken them, before evil Cuſtoms of Life deaden their vigor; as it happens to the body from an Obſtruction in the Nerves: For doubtleſs all Evil is a kind of <hi>Intellectual Opium,</hi> caſts the Faculties of the mind (as I may ſo ſay) into a <hi>Moral Apoplexy;</hi> and ſo according to the opinion of one Philoſopher blots the White Paper; according to another it is deſtructive of the very firſt principles in Nature: whereas he, who lays his Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation upon the principles of Virtue, ſhall direct the courſe of his Life with that Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, as will bear him up under all the Accidents, he can be expoſed to; he will be guided by ſuch Rules, as he never needs Change; but his whole Life will be blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61474:39"/>
his Actions well weigh'd, his Words diſcreet, his Thoughts regular, and in all things ſhall he live according to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt perfection Human Nature is capable of.</p>
            <p>YOUTH being an Age fitteſt to learn not only the rudiments of divers Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, but the moſt uſeful Knowledge both of God and of our ſelves; becauſe in Youth the Powers of the mind and the Strength of the body are alike vigorous, clear and active; the Inſtrument is not as yet broken, nor out of tune; the Organs are not yet diſturbed; the Underſtanding is not bribed with Error; nor the Will as yet grown ſtubborn and ſtiff in bad Courſes; Prejudices are not ſtrong enough to darken the Object, or the Faculty that is to apprehend them; the Habits of Vice are as yet unlearned and unpractiſed; the Memory is not at leiſure to furniſh its Store-houſe with vain <hi>Idea</hi>'s; it is neither choakt with Straw, nor ſtopt wth Mud; the Impertinency of worldly buſineſs is not yet become a burden too heavy for the mind to bear.</p>
            <p>BESIDES all Impreſſions made in the days of Youth are ſtrong and deep, ſo that what is now well fix'd in the Soul, will not eaſily leave it: And if the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61474:39"/>
of Virtue, like ſmall and gentle Rain, be by degrees diſtilled on the growing Plant, the riper Age is like to bring forth a more plentiful harveſt; for Vertue only preſcribes to a man a true and certain end to all his Endeavours, which is the Glory of God in the firſt place, then the doing as much Good as he can, to himſelf and others: This being the moſt high and noble End, the ſooner one ſets about it the better 'tis; for thereby we avoid all lowneſs of Spirit, confuſion in our Actions, and all inconſtancy in our Reſolutions: And that Youth is beſt prepared for this work, is manifeſt, becauſe it is an Age ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry inquiſitive; equally capable, and poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly inclined to Good, as Evil; and many of thoſe Sins, which owe both their Birth and Growth to the Senſes, are not yet ſit Temptations; the Paſſions are not yet rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to catch fire at every ſpark; the feign'd, but falſe Beauty of Vice is not alluring; the Virgin Purity of the mind is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>floured, nor its native Modeſty laid waſt. But if this Age be not uſed to the ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Labour, and the ſtrict exerciſes of Virtue, ſenſual Pleaſures will break in, and then is kindled that continual Combat, ſo much ſpoken of by Philoſophers and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61474:40"/>
Divines, between Senſe and Reaſon, the Body and the Soul, Pleaſure and Wiſdom.</p>
            <p>WHEN the Blood therefore is warm; the Paſſions run high and are powerful, but Reaſon is weak; when the Body, like an unruly Beaſt, is untame and unbroken; when Reaſon and Judgment are, like the Morning Star, ſtifled and overcaſt with Vapours; then it is proper to put on a Bitt and Bridle; to keep ſtrong Reins, and a ſteddy Hand: Then Youth is to be held in, from thoſe Deluſions, that hinder the true Underſtanding and real Notions of things; from all ill Company and Writings, leaſt they ſhould be taken with the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, but falſe colours, that are put upon vicious and bad manners.</p>
            <p>FOR Young Men naturally think they can do, and may do every thing, as they liſt; they are blind, therefore the more bold; they are impotent, but yet preſumptuous; Fancy is now as active, as the Wind, but withal it is diſorderly and tempeſtuous: Youth is not idle, and yet ſeldom well imployed; it is reſtleſs and very impertinent: it being that part of our time,<note place="margin">Youth is in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt danger of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</note> wherein we are moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the Snares of the Devil; theſe are troubled Waters in which his Baits are ſeldom ſeen, and therefore they are the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61474:40"/>
more greedily ſwallowed: Upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it concerns men much in their Youth to remember their Creator, becauſe he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can protect them from their Enemies of all ſorts: Their Clay is, as it were, but juſt formed into Human ſhape; it is but as yet ſcarce dry from the Potter's hand: And as it is now in the beſt manner fitted for the Signatures of Virtue; ſo it is moſt lyable to the Impreſſions of Sin and the Father of it: They are now as Tradesmen newly ſet up; their Souls are well furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a common ſtock of Natural Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and their Bodies are adorn'd like the richeſt Shop, in which the Trade of Life and Happineſs is to be driven: They ſhould therefore be careful in a ſpecial manner, that they do not break at the firſt ſetting up, as unwary Merchants are wont to do; for their rational Faculties, the choiceſt Goods of the mind, will waſt and decay, if they are wrapt up in Idleneſs, and the Devil will gain Advantages over them: So that it behoves them to reſiſt his Temptations at firſt; to ſet the ſtrongeſt Guard in the weakeſt place, and to double the ſecurity, where they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the ſharpeſt Aſſaults; to oppoſe his Craft with Watchfulneſs; his Subtilty with

ſtrict and unwearied diligence; to ſtudy God's Service in the firſt place, and to <hi>do their actions the beſtway:</hi> And ſince in every Age the ſame Faculties are employed, only the Objects changed, and the Actions of thoſe Faculties are not many; it muſt needs be that our whole Life is but the <hi>Reacting</hi> the ſame things over upon divers Subjects and occaſions: in Infancy little quarrels with our Brethren and peeviſhneſs, are afterwards <hi>Angers, Hatreds, Envies, Prides, Jealouſies;</hi> and a ſenſibleneſs in Youth for a frivolous Play-thing is the ſame afterwards for Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or Intereſt: If it be ſo, then He that begins early to love and fear God, will ſo increaſe in virtuous Deeds, which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent thereupon, that his Converſation will be in every reſpect as becomes the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>AND ſince a ſeaſonable time is a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance requiſite both to the Eſſence and Ornament of every Action: in that time therefore, in which the abilities of our Minds are freſh and lively; thoſe of the Body alſo vigorous and ſtrong; it is pity we ſhould be idle and do nothing; and yet more, that we ſhould be active and do evil; we muſt think it a very unjuſt, as well as unreaſonable thing to ſpend the flower and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61474:41"/>
fruit of our Age upon this; when Vertue and Religion have only broken Intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, dead Affections, a ſlippery Memory, and a tired Judgment, beſides all other infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that neceſſarily attend the ruin of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in old Age; when men do every thing leſs earneſtly, than is fit; when they are of poor and mean Spirits, as having been hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by the chances of Life; when they have weak or no deſires,<note place="margin">The unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of old Age for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of Vertue.</note> and Hearts to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute nothing; when they are full of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring and complaint, as ever thinking themſelves not far from ſome evil or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; So that this is an Age too much a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to its ſelf, and to all about it, than to be able, to go through all the ſervices of Vertue. For who can expect Grapes of Thorns, or Figs of Thiſtles; the moroſe and froward time of our Life; the Froſt, Snow and Winter ſeaſon being not for Fruit any more in the workings of Vertue, than it is in Nature: it being very difficult to begin the Chriſtian Race, when that of Nature is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt finiſhed, which good Fight is a hard warfare far old and decrepit Limbs.</p>
            <p>NOW the Prudence of old Age conſiſts in a deliberate knowledg of Men and Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, founded upon long experience; but the Folly of it is the ignorance of Vertue and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61474:42"/>
Religion, which at laſt will appear the only true and real Wiſdom. Therefore the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Philoſopher chaſtiſes the neglect and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretion of thoſe Men, who then begin to live, when they are to die; there being little ſupport and leſs comfort in declining years, beſides a <hi>ſober</hi> reflection upon what <hi>we have done</hi> well; and nothing can ſweeten a ſour and crabbed Age, but the calling to mind a good Life paſſed: For as Vertue and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is the moſt excellent accompliſhment of Youth; ſo the innocency thereof is the joy and Crown of gray Hairs: which are then truly honourable, when they are found in the way of Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>WHEREFORE let us not deceive our own Souls, but with all our might follow the ſervices of Vertue, as ſoon as we are able to diſtinguiſh between true and falſe, good and evil: Let weak and diſeaſed Perſons preſent themſelves to their Prince and ſee, if they can perſuade him to turn his Court into an Hoſpital, make up his Guards with Cripples, and be attended with nothing, but Age and Impotency: If the King will not do this, how can we expect that God ſhould; as if the buſineſs of Religion were to be done, when we are capable of doing nothing, as we ſhould do; and God were to be ſatisfied
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61474:42"/>
with thoſe poor remainders of Strength and Spirit, which the hard ſervices of Sin and the Devil have left us: No ſure; This is an undertaking far more noble and difficult, the work of Angels in Heaven and of the wiſeſt Men upon Earth, and then is moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, when it is the Employment of our firſt and beſt Age.</p>
            <p>FROM what hath been ſaid then, this Inference may be made; that Youth muſt be taught to moderate their Paſſions, and not be left undiſciplined, till Age and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience have wrought it in them. And the way to learn Vertue is to watch over our Paſſions betimes, and to make choice of that degree, which <hi>befits</hi> us. For the actions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Habit, and by which the Habit is created, differ not <hi>ſpecie,</hi> but only in perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from thoſe, which follow the Habit; and it is a general Law, which is laid upon all things, that are acquired by Study, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe from Imperfection to Perfection, from Weakneſs to Strength.</p>
            <p>WHICH Perfection conſiſts in this, to demean our ſelves upon all occaſions, <hi>pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, wiſely,</hi> and <hi>adviſedly:</hi> inſomuch that ſome <hi>Moraliſts</hi> have doubted, whether all <hi>Moral Vertues</hi> may not be ſumm'd up in one, namely <hi>Prudence, nullum numen abeſt, ſi ſit
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61474:43"/>
Prudentia:</hi> Wherefore that multiplicity of Vertues, which is delivered by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> was only for our more eaſie learning the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of this one into ſundry parts; that ſo we might as it were eat by <hi>ſpoonfuls,</hi> where we cannot ſwallow at once <hi>the whole Meſs.</hi> But before we treat of the Vertues in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, it will beneceſſary to conſider cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Rules and Obſervations, which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath made, becauſe they do not a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the practice of Vertue.</p>
            <p>FIRST, Leſt we ſhould flatter our ſelves in thinking, that we have attained unto Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, before indeed we have; we muſt learn to diſtinguiſh between the doing of what is <hi>Good</hi> and the doing <hi>it well;</hi> betwixt <hi>bonum agere &amp; benè agere:</hi> For in all kinds of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, we may do that for <hi>good,</hi> which proves at the laſt an evil Action through the defect of ſome Circumſtance.</p>
            <p>Secondly, THAT we may not only do that,<note place="margin">The cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> which is good, but do it well; we muſt conſider, that a multitude of Circumſtances attend every virtuous Action that we do; the firſt thing to be known is, who it is, that doth the Action; for every thing becomes not every Man: as for Example, when in the Council of <hi>Sparta,</hi> a wicked Perſon had given good Advice, the Senators took care,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61474:43"/>
that a Man of better Credit ſhould give the ſame, leſt the Council, which was good and wiſe, might be ſuſpected, and have ill ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, through the bad Character of him, who gave it: So in receiving Courteſies, we muſt take heed, we receive not every thing of every Man in every place; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; For it is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace to be obliged by an unworthy Giver; And <hi>Abraham</hi> would accept no gift from the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Sodom,</hi> that he might not ſay, <hi>I have made Abraham rich:</hi> again, we muſt conſider, what it is, that is done; For as <hi>Circumſtances</hi> require, ſo Actions are cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured either for good or bad; We are bound alſo to conſider, where an Action is done; For all Actions are not in all places alike: Theſe three conſiderations are very well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the Advice, which Q. <hi>Cicero</hi> gave to his Brother <hi>Marcus,</hi> when He ſued for the Conſulſhip; For He exhorts him thus to think, <hi>Novus ſum, Conſulatum peto, Roma eſt;</hi> in the words <hi>Novus ſum</hi> is ſignified the Perſon, who made the Suit; for an Upſtart was to bear himſelf otherwiſe in his Petition, than <hi>vir Patricius,</hi> an ancient Nobleman: in <hi>Conſulatum peto</hi> is implyed the ſecond Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, what it was He ſued for, the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme place of Government in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth;
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61474:44"/>
and <hi>Roma eſt</hi> ſhews the Place, where his <hi>Suit</hi> lay, not in <hi>ulubrae</hi> a <hi>petty Market Town,</hi> but in that Chief City of the Empire.</p>
            <p>MANY other Circumſtances there are, by which our Actions are to be managed: the chief whereof are contained in that known Verſe,
<q xml:lang="lat">Quis, quid, ubi, quibus auxiliis, cur, quomodo, quando.</q>
He, that can carefully obſerve all theſe Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and ſhall do what they require; that Man only ſhall diſcreetly diſcharge eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part of Virtue, and behave himſelf accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to to the beſt Reaſon:<note place="margin">What Reaſon is.</note> For by <hi>Reaſon</hi> we mean nothing but the Mind of Man ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king uſe of the wiſeſt and moſt prudential Methods, to guide it ſelf in all its Actions; and therefore it is not confined to any ſort of Maxims and Principles in Philoſophy, but it extends it ſelf to any knowledg that may be gained by Prudence, Experience and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, HAVING already aſſerted, that <hi>Virtue</hi> is lodged in the middle between two Extremes, which are both <hi>Vices,</hi> and both its Adverſaries, we do now ſay, that the two Extremes, are not for the moſt part a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61474:44"/>
repugnant to it; but the one approaches nearer, than the other: As for inſtance, <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeneſs,</hi> one extreme of Liberality, doth much more partake of that Virtue, and comes nearer it, than the other extreme, which is <hi>Avarice;</hi> for this reaſon Men uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally pity the Prodigal, but abominate and hate the Covetous. In this caſe therefore our Rule muſt be, to decline that <hi>Extreme,</hi> which is the more hateful, and lean rather to that other, which is more friendly and like the Virtue, which we deſign to practiſe: But we muſt carry our ſelves ſo circumſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that we do not fall into the Crime cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd by the Poet,
<q xml:lang="lat">Dum vitant Stulti vitia in contraria currunt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, WE can do nothing <hi>well</hi> or <hi>virtuouſly,</hi> unleſs we diligently look into and try our own natural Inclinations;<note place="margin">What our natural inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are, and how they are to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned.</note> which are nearer to us, than all things elſe, and yet nothing is farther off from our Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; we muſt examine all the windings and Labyrinths of our whole Frame, and ſee, by what Pullies and Wheels all the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our Minds are performed; ſo that we may follow her workings from the firſt impreſſions of Senſe, then of the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Judgment into the Principles both
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61474:45"/>
of Natural and Supernatural Motions: Then we may, as in a Glaſs, perceive, how the Soul arbitrates in the Underſtanding upon the ſeveral reports of Senſe and all the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties of Imagination; how pliant the Will is to her Dictates, and obeys her, as a Queen doth her King, who both acknowledges a Subjection and yet retains a Majeſty; How the Paſſions move at her Command, like a well governed Army, not for Fighting, but for Rank and Order; from which regular compoſure of the Faculties, all moving in their due Place, each ſtriking in its proper Time, there ariſes a Complacency upon the whole Soul, infinitely beyond all other plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</p>
            <p>BUT there is no Man, that hath his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties ſo equally balanc'd, or his Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſo juſtly poiſed, as that he doth not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to one of the extremes of <hi>Virtue</hi> more, than to the other: Whoſoever then would walk in the middle path of a <hi>good life,</hi> muſt take particular care to avoid that Rock, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he is moſt apt to fall.</p>
            <p>FOR when a Perſon skilful in <hi>Phyſiogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> was asked to give his judgment upon the natural temper of <hi>Socrates,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Socrates</hi> his great Maſtery over him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</note> and had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared him to be prone to Luſt and Senſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; the Company about him grew angry,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61474:45"/>
and young <hi>Alcibiades</hi> brake out into a Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: But <hi>Socrates</hi> replied, that the Opinion of the Man was right; for ſuch indeed he confeſſed he <hi>was by Nature,</hi> but by <hi>aſſiduous</hi> care and <hi>pains</hi> he had corrected thoſe Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations. So much the more induſtrious ought we to be in watching over our own natural Diſpoſitions, not only becauſe we ſlide very faſt and eaſily into <hi>Vice,</hi> where we find our ſelves ſtrongly inclined to it; but becauſe we are apt to offend on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hand, and pronounce our ſelves <hi>vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous,</hi> when there is little or no cauſe ſo to do.</p>
            <p>HENCE it is, that many Men, as <hi>Nazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anzen</hi> obſerves, attribute that unto <hi>Grace,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Some things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to Grace, which are due to Nature.</note> which is indeed due to <hi>Nature;</hi> For a man, who by his natural diſpoſition is Phlegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick and Cold, ſoon flatters himſelf with an Opinion of Chaſtity; whereas in truth his Conſtitution doth not miniſter to him ſuch luſtful Heats, as are found in others of a more Sanguine Complexion: where the flame of Luſt or Anger breaketh out, and other po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Allurements to <hi>evil</hi> make their Aſſaults, there is the trial of <hi>Virtue;</hi> For what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation is it to ſtand upright and unſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, where no Reſiſtance is made: In fair and calm Weather an ordinary Pilot may
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61474:46"/>
ſteer the Ship; but he acts the part of a skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Mariner, who can govern the Helm and hold his Courſe, when the Seas work, the Winds are high, and the Tempeſt ſtrong. So it is with <hi>Virtue</hi> in <hi>Human Life;</hi> She muſt rule all thoſe Paſſions that raiſe ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Tumults in our Veins, and then ſhe is moſt glorious, when ſhe prevails, where the Temptations are moſt powerful; theſe Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories are not to be gotten by the Starts and Sallies of the Mind, but by a reſolute and conſtant Habit: For it deſerves much more praiſe to lead an <hi>unblameable life</hi> by our own ſtudy and labour, than to be ſo by our natural Condition. Wherefore up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on diſcovery of our ſelves, where we find Paſſion ſtrongeſt and moſt apt to be infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, there is the greateſt occaſion for the exerciſe of <hi>Virtue,</hi> to ſubdue its outrage and to make it an Inſtrument of <hi>doing well.</hi> Laſtly, There is one Rule or rather Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel more, given by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and it is this; That in all the Negotiations of Life we take heed eſpecially, how we do admit, as Counſellours, <hi>our Pleaſure</hi> or our <hi>Pain:</hi> For Pleaſures ſollicit only unto Vice, and Pains deter us from <hi>Virtue:</hi>
               <note place="margin">The dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Pleaſure.</note> the former we ought to be as ſuſpicious of, as the <hi>Trojans</hi> were of <hi>Helena,</hi> when they ſaw, how handſom
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61474:46"/>
ſhe was; they preſently began to think it better to ſend her home, than ſuffer their Country to be deſtroyed for her ſake: No leſs hazard do we run in yielding to Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; which for the moſt part begin <hi>in Folly, grow up in trouble,</hi> and <hi>conclude in ſhame:</hi> For when we ſtep out of the way of <hi>Virtue;</hi> if we aim at <hi>Mirth,</hi> that will preſently end in <hi>Grief;</hi> if <hi>Ambition,</hi> then we are killed with <hi>Affronts;</hi> if it be Luſt, then it wounds us with the loſs of our <hi>good name:</hi> In ſhort, Pleaſures of all kinds wear the diſguiſe of Beauty and Lovelineſs; like the Harlot in the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> they entice with wanton Kiſſes; as ſhe decks her Bed with the covering of Tapeſtry and perfumes her Houſe; but all this while 'tis the Road to Hell, and leads to the Chambers of Death: ſo whoriſh and impudent is the face of <hi>pleaſure;</hi> it makes uſe of looſe Geſtures, ſmooth and Amorous Addreſſes to draw in the unwary Sinner; all this while ſhe is but a <hi>painted Snake,</hi> which is no ſooner taken into the Boſom, but the fatal ſting appears; it ſtrikes and wounds with an everlaſting Venom, and beſides the deadly gaſhes it makes in the Conſciences of Men, it infects all the preſent Joys of <hi>humane Life.</hi> In the right Government therefore of our Actions it behoves us not
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:61474:47"/>
to ſtoop for ſuch <hi>golden Apples,</hi> that are caſt in the way to hinder our work: That great Sophiſt <hi>Leontinus Georgias</hi> arrived in good health to an hundred and eight Years of Age, and being asked, <hi>What Cordial that was, which had preſerved him in health to ſo great an Age?</hi> anſwered, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>quod nihil unquam volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis gratiâ fecerat:</hi> So great a preſerver of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Health,</hi> and of all the good things conſequent thereupon is abſtinence from Pleaſures, from the Exceſſes of Eating and Drinking: for He that eats too much, dozes away his Life, turns his over-charged Body into a Statue of <hi>Earth,</hi> and ſeems to live in a continual Lethargy; He, who drinks to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, drenches his Brains in unwholſom Clouds of moiſture, and waſhes away the principles of <hi>common Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Diſcretion:</hi> He, that is lacivious, is puniſh'd for it with noiſom Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers, and the peace of his <hi>Mind</hi> is quite deſtroyed by <hi>mad</hi> and <hi>ungovernable deſires.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HITHERTO we have diſcourſed of ſuch matters, as concern all <hi>Virtues</hi> in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, it remains, that we explain the Nature of them in particular. The Ancients were wont to divide <hi>Virtues</hi> into Cardinal or Principal, and <hi>Virtues</hi> leſs principal: The Cardinal <hi>Virtues</hi> they accounted to be four,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:61474:47"/>
               <hi>Prudence, Fortitude, Temperance,</hi> and <hi>Juſtice;</hi> becauſe, as they thought, all others of an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Order, as <hi>Magnanimity, Magnificence, Liberality,</hi> &amp;c. were reducible unto theſe Four.</p>
            <p>BUT we need not tie our ſelves up to the ſtrict Rules of Method, becauſe it is not of any moment upon what peculiar <hi>Virtue</hi> we diſcourſe firſt: We will therefore follow <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and begin with</p>

               <p>

Tho perhaps it is no Paſſion, becauſe a Man may have it, who doth nothing; neither is it an Habit, becauſe he may be born with Courage; it muſt then be a power of the Soul, placed chiefly in the ſenſitive Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, becauſe it depends much upon the Heats of Blood, and is common to all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:<note place="margin">A Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.</note> But <hi>Tully</hi> tells us, <hi>Fortitudo eſt viri propria virtus;</hi> it moſt properly belongs to and becomes a Man beſt; wherefore by the <hi>Greeks</hi> it is called <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. Which Courage (to convince you, how much it is purely Mechanical) may proceed in ſome meaſure from the temper of Air, may be form'd by Diſcipline, and acquired by Uſe, or infuſed by Opinion; But that which is more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and ſo more National in ſome Countries, than in others, ſeems to ariſe from the heat or ſtrength of Spirits about the Heart, which may a great deal depend upon the meaſure and the ſubſtance of the Food Men are uſed to: This made a Phyſician once ſay, He would make any Man a Coward with ſix weeks Dieting; For this Reaſon, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> having their Bellies full of Beef; have been eſteemed moſt fit for any bold and deſperate Action: This alſo may be a reaſon, why the Gentry in all places of the World, are braver than the Peaſantry, whoſe
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:61474:48"/>
Hearts are depreſſed not only by Slavery, but ſhort and heartleſs Food, the effect of their poverty: This is a Cauſe, why the Yeomanry of <hi>England</hi> are generally Stouter than in other Countries, becauſe by the Conſtitution of the Kingdom they live eaſier as to Rents and Taxes; by the plenty thereof they fare better, than thoſe of their Rank in any other Nation: Their Chief, and indeed conſtant Food being of Fleſh; And among all Creatures, both Birds and Beaſts, we ſhall ſtill find thoſe, that feed upon Fleſh, to be the fierce and the bold; and on the contrary the fearful and faint-hearted to feed upon Graſs, and upon Plants. Thus the veins of Courage ſeem to run like veins of Good Earth in a Country: And ſome People are ſo far from having a firm and conſtant Valour in them, that I can compare them to nothing better, than the Scare-Crows, Children make of ſtraw, wherewith they ſtuff empty Cloaths, they look like Men, but they have no <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Secondly, THE Actions of this Virtue are moſt ſplendid and great: therefore they were always aſcribed to the <hi>Demy-gods</hi> by the Ancients; and <hi>Moſes</hi> attributes <hi>Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> to God himſelf, when he ſaith, <hi>Jehovah</hi>

is a <hi>God of War,</hi> and commonly ſtileth him the <hi>Lord of Hoſts.</hi> Now all Virtues are to be defined by thoſe Objects, about which they are converſant,<note place="margin">Fortitude defined.</note> and by the Actions which they perform: By which Rule we may define <hi>Fortitude</hi> to be that Virtue, which teacheth us to moderate our <hi>Fears</hi> and our <hi>Confidence;</hi> at what time and place to encounter Dangers and Difficulties; when and where to decline and avoid them; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially if there be any fear or hazard of Death, according to the Doctrine of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> of all things the moſt terrible and ghaſtly. The Courage therefore of a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant and wiſe Man is chiefly ſeen in run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Riſque of War, and all the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs, that follow upon it, for his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, for his Religion, for his Liberty: As for all matters of leſs importance, it is as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent a part of <hi>Fortitude,</hi> to <hi>fear Death</hi> and <hi>fly Dangers</hi> as it is to <hi>undertake</hi> and <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage</hi> them. The Extremes oppoſed to this Virtue on one hand are <hi>Raſhneſs, Fury,</hi> and the like; on the other ſide are oppoſite <hi>timorouſneſs</hi> and want of <hi>Spirit.</hi> When he deſcribes the Object of this Virtue, <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> miſtakes himſelf many ways; in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vervaluing ſome things, as <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty;</hi> which are of no price in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:61474:49"/>
with the <hi>fear of God,</hi> or the Care of Religion, which he either did not regard, or knew nothing of it. As for <hi>Life,</hi> the <hi>Stoicks</hi> have delivered better Precepts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it, when they tell us, <hi>non eſt magna res vivere,</hi> and conſequently, <hi>non eſt magna res mori;</hi> tho, in regard of Death, ſo great a proviſion is to be made againſt it, as they believed, ſo many Circumſtances of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibility</hi> and <hi>hardineſs of Mind</hi> are urged, and all its Forces are muſtered together, that they ſeem to have conſented with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle</hi> in making Death to be the moſt <hi>dreadful thing imaginable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>FOR if common <hi>Honeſty</hi> and <hi>Integrity</hi> be valued, as it ought to be,<note place="margin">Honeſty and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity the moſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable things.</note> the meaneſt part of it, is more precious, than all the poſſeſſions of this World, and will much o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verballance the Torments of Death; and rather than we ſhould ſuffer the leaſt part of our <hi>Integrity</hi> to fall to the ground, we ought to venture upon all Perils whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. And it is worth our obſerving, that there is no paſſion in the mind of Man ſo weak, but it maſters the fear of Death; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge triumphs over it; Love ſlights it; Honour aſpires after it; Grief flies to it; Nay pity the tendereſt of them all, provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked many of <hi>Otho</hi>'s Followers to die in

compaſſion to their Emperour, who had ſlain himſelf; and <hi>Seneca</hi> adds, <hi>mori velle, non tantum Fortis, aut miſer, ſed etiam fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtidioſus poteſt,</hi> A Man would die, tho he were neither Valiant, nor miſerable, only upon a wearineſs to do the ſame thing, ſo oft over and over. But then it is eaſieſt to leave this World, when we have ſuch expectations of a happier State, as the Chriſtian Faith gives us; they, who are ſtrangers to theſe hopes, fear Death, as Children are afraid to go in the dark; and as that natural Fear in Children, is increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>Tales,</hi> ſo is the other with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of <hi>philoſophers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, THE <hi>Peripatetick</hi> extols <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> as the Object of <hi>Fortitude:</hi> This hath been very much cryed up by the <hi>Ethnick</hi> Wiſemen, and likewiſe by miſtake among ſome Chriſtians, ſuch as the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> in the Apoſtles times, who were ſo far from being Valiant in the maintenance of their Faith, that they pleaded their Chriſtian Liberty on the behalf of their cowardly Revolts from it in the time of Perſecution: And ſome Errours of another kind about Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, have been the cauſe of Wars and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, of Bloudſhed and Rebellions, as much as any other thing whatſoever. Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:61474:50"/>
who certainly underſtood the Nature, and the price of Liberty much better, than <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle,</hi> left us this Rule; Art <hi>Thou called a Slave</hi> (for ſo I rather render the word <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious power of doing what we liſt, it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther poſſible for Men living in Society to have it, neither if it were poſſible, were it either ſafe or fit. For a Meteor therefore of the Brain, a Fiction, and a thing of naught to raiſe ſuch ſtirs in the World, to ſpill ſo much Bloud, and to hazard ſo many Souls, muſt needs be an horrible attempt, and whoſoever they be that do it,<note place="margin">The true Object of Fortitude Danger.</note> their <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> ſleeps not. Without any farther De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate then, we do aſſert, that the true Object of <hi>Fortitude</hi> is Danger, and it is the duty of a Valiant Man, who muſt be a good Man, to behave himſelf without terrour; yet ſo that he be ſenſible, it behoves him ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:61474:51"/>
to <hi>fear;</hi> For to be altogether without Fear, is rather to be furious and <hi>mad,</hi> than <hi>valiant;</hi> and to be fool-hardy, or needleſly to precipitate our ſelves upon Dangers, is the groſſeſt Folly that may be; and no Vice is more to be dreaded, or gives plainer ſigns of a very corrupt Heart, than the want of this Fear, when there is juſt occaſion for it: And no other end ought a Man to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to himſelf, than <hi>common Honeſty</hi> and <hi>right Reaſon,</hi> neither ought he to fear any thing but <hi>Turpitude</hi> and <hi>Diſhoneſty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>NOW becauſe there are ſundry things, which abuſe us, and carry a ſhew of <hi>Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi> yet have not the true reaſon of it; we will ſee what they are: The firſt is called by <hi>Ariſtotle, Politick</hi> or <hi>legal Fortitude,</hi> when Men for fear of the Law, and the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of it, or for hope of Reward, from the deſire of Honour, or to avoid Diſgrace, put <hi>on a ſeeming Fortitude:</hi> whereas real Valour doth brave and great things <hi>ex offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio,</hi> as I may ſo ſay, out of Conſcience only that it is our duty ſo to act, and not out of fear of any Command or Injunction: To this Notion may be applied that famous Story of the <hi>Athenians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">How the Valour of the <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> was tried.</note> who deſiring much to diſcover the true reaſon of the ſtoutneſs of the <hi>Spartans,</hi> ſent a Wiſe and Sagacious
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:61474:51"/>

               </p>
               <p>TO this we may add very pertinently ſome other Reaſons, that move Men to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form deſperate Acts rather than Valiant.<note place="margin">A Man may do deſperate Actions, and not be Valiant.</note> So a Soldier in <hi>Lucullus</hi> his Army, who had loſt his Purſe, and being called to Fight, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved himſelf bravely, and got the day a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Enemy; but being taken notice of by his Captain, as a ſtout Fellow, and commanded to do a piece of Service, in which he muſt needs run ſome evident dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he deſired to be excuſed, and ſaid, <hi>eat, qui Zonam perdidit;</hi> He had found his Purſe, and meant to ſleep in a whole Skin: Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of this way of Life, <hi>being ſickly,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed much Courage in daring and adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing upon any hard Enterprize: His Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:61474:52"/>
in Compaſſion to his infirmities com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits him to the Phyſician; and by this means being reſtored to perfect Health, he is no longer the man he was, but bore back when Danger was ſeen, ſaying, he now knew, that Life was ſweet, which before he did not eſteem ſo. More inſtances might be given of men, whoſe Profeſſion is the Exerciſe of Courage, but theſe may ſuffice to ſhew, that the Fortitude which we call Politick, comes ſhort of the true Valour, which we account a Virtue.</p>
               <p>A ſecond Mock-Fortitude is that, which is gained by much experience, and may be named <hi>experiential Fortitude:</hi> And this Fable may explain to us what experience is; it is of one, who pretended to have been miraculouſly cured of Blindneſs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he was born, by St. <hi>Alban,</hi> or <hi>ſome other Saint</hi> at the Town of St. <hi>Albans;</hi> and that the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> being there, to be ſatisfied of the truth of the Miracle, asked the man, What <hi>Colour</hi> is this? who by anſwering it was <hi>green,</hi> diſcovered himſelf and was puniſhed for a Counterfeit; for though, by his ſight newly received, he might diſtinguiſh between <hi>green</hi> and <hi>red,</hi> and all other Colours as well as any one elſe; yet he could not poſſibly know at firſt which
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:61474:52"/>
of them was called <hi>green</hi> or <hi>red,</hi> or by any other Name: by this we may underſtand, there be two kinds of Knowledge where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the one is nothing elſe but <hi>Senſe;</hi> the other is called <hi>Science</hi> or the Knowledge of the Truth of Propoſitions and how things are called: Both of theſe ſorts are but <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</hi> Now this <hi>experien<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> in a valiant Man, makes him ready and apt to lay hold of any occaſion, that ſhall provoke him to fight; whereas men that are not <hi>experienced</hi> are commonly fearful; or if they are by chance daring and bold,<note place="margin">Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in a valiant man.</note> they are for the moſt part unfortunate, by reaſon of their Miſtake in Time and Place, and other Circumſtances, which <hi>well-experienc'd</hi> men do know: Wherefore of Fortitude up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Experience and Education the <hi>Switzers</hi> are a pregnant example, who being trained up to the practices of War, have made it a <hi>Trade of Life;</hi> they are every man's Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and let the Cauſe be what it will, good or bad, it is no part of their Care, ſo their Wages be duly paid them; ſuch men are commonly fit for ſervice, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Mercenaries</hi> they many times fail, and <hi>change</hi> their parties upon change of <hi>Hire:</hi> like the <hi>Gladiators</hi> of old <hi>Rome,</hi> they make no Conſcience where they fight, but ſight
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:61474:53"/>
they will, only becauſe <hi>neceſſity</hi> or <hi>hire</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acts it of them.</p>
               <p>A third kind of Seeming Courage, is that, which ariſes from Anger: Now Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage in a large ſignification, is the abſence of Fear in the preſence of any Evil what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever; but in a ſtrict and more common meaning it <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> contempt of Wounds and Death, when they oppoſe a Man in the way to his End; therefore Anger or ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Courage is nothing but the Appetite or Deſire of overcoming preſent Oppoſition: But it being, as I have called it, a ſudden Paſſion, it is wont to incite men and caſt them improvidently upon dangers: there goes a common Saying, and it paſſeth for <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotles,</hi> That, <hi>Ira eſt fortitudinis Cos:</hi> But it is more likely, that he, who knew ſo well the uſe of good Reaſon would not commit the ſharpening of Fortitude; to ſo harſh an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument; but rather do by Fortitude, when it needs ſharpening, as Barbers do by their Raſors, pour Oyl upon the Stone: For Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is alone able to beget in us a true Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, though Anger and Fury never interpoſe.</p>
               <p>A Fourth kind of <hi>ſeeming</hi> Courage is valour upon Hope; when we undertake great matters upon Expectation of Victory, Honour, Glory, or ſuch like Vanities; for
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:61474:53"/>
Hope is nothing but the Expectation of Good, as Fear is the Expectation of Evil; there are Cauſes alternately working in the mind, ſome that make us expect Good; and ſome that make us expect Evil; if the former prevail then the whole Paſſion is <hi>Hope,</hi> if the latter, then the whole is <hi>Fear:</hi> Now Hope is the greateſt Cheat to, and Abuſer or Men; for in this are founded all the vain, though ſpecious Attempts, which men have caſt themſelves upon; whether it be of the <hi>Arena,</hi> where the Gladiators ſported themſelves in the moſt bloody and cruel Exerciſes, for no other end but only Hope of Conqueſt, or whether it be any other gallant Madneſs and Vain-Glory, ſuch as reading of <hi>Romances</hi> may produce in puſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animous men, as it did in <hi>Don Quixotte.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>UNTO the ſame order of things we may add all thoſe famous Madneſſes and Furies ſo much ſung of, and celebrated by Proſe-Writers and Poets, I mean the <hi>Olympian, Nemaean, Pythian</hi> and <hi>Iſthmaean</hi> Games; wherein the choiceſt and faireſt young men tryed their utmoſt Strength to no purpoſe: For it is ſo noted, whoſoever won the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the Olympian Games, were for ever after good for nothing: All the Sun and Duſt they ſo patiently endured, was only
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:61474:54"/>
for a Crown of Bays; that they might not enter their Towns by the Gates or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Paſſages but be carried home upon mens Shoulders: Were it worth our while to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider theſe things, it would ſtrike us into an Amazement, to ſee, what Honour hath ever been done to mere Trifles, to things utterly of no uſe, and that for ſo many Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years ſpace, from Thirty Years or thereabouts before the Building of <hi>Rome,</hi> until almoſt the expiration of that Empire, with a general Applauſe and Concourſe of almoſt the whole World: Upon this have we grounded all our books and monuments of Learning, which concern our Epochaes and Dates of time,<note place="margin">The Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian Games great Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.</note> as it were to bear Witneſs againſt our ſelves, how vain we are by making and framing our memorials by thoſe things, that were the greateſt Follies, that ever were.</p>
               <p>BUT this may repreſent to us the Nature of Mankind; and ſhew us by what ſprings they are moved; how the little hopes of empty Honour or Profit will drive 'em in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the moſt hazardous Attempts;<note place="margin">Honour and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit drive men upon the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards.</note> how ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily they ſwallow the moſt bitter Pills, when they are gilt over; how ambitiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they hunt after the Troubles of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and baſely adore the fine and gaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy nothings of this Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:61474:54"/>ONE kind of falſe Fortitude ſtill remains, and that is Courage <hi>upon ignorance,</hi> when through want of Experience and Knowledg we ruſh unadviſedly upon the Swords point, and walk upon the very edge of a Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice: For that of <hi>Thucydides</hi> is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, Ignorance and Unexperience makes men bold and foolhardy, but good Advice is naturally ſlow-placed: Thus it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly obſerved, that your freſh-water Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers go to the Battel, as chearfully as if they went to a Wedding, but as ſoon as they ſee their own Blood, their Hearts fail them. Something allied is this Valour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Ignorance</hi> with that upon <hi>Hope;</hi> for therefore do men run upon Danger, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have a Hope to ſpeed well, and come off without Harm: For as ſoon as the Danger, which they knew not, begins to appear in its own Colours their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy leaves them, and none more readily run away: The Men of <hi>Argos</hi> waging Warr with the <hi>Sicyonians,</hi> and beating them often it happened that the <hi>Syconians</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained the <hi>Spartans</hi> for help who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the Field, in Habit and Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture like the <hi>Syconians,</hi> whilſt they were undiſcovered, the People of <hi>Argos</hi> fought

ſtoutly, as againſt their accuſtomed Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but as ſoon as they percieved they were <hi>Spartans,</hi> without more adoe, they fled.</p>
               <p>MANY more things might be ſaid by way of farther opening the Nature of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, but we will ſhut up all with this one Concluſion, that it is not Hope, nor Anger,<note place="margin">The Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of the Cauſe warrants men to be valiant.</note> nor Reward, nor any thing elſe, but only the conſideration of the <hi>Goodneſs and Lawfulneſs of the Cauſe, that warrants men to be valiant:</hi> elſe Thieves and Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers might be accounted ſo, whoſe Courage is like Zeal and Learning in a Heretick, wholly bent upon doing Miſchief; elſe raſh and unadviſed Perſons, and ſuch as palliate their Luſt under the name of Love, and every one that is carried on by the ſtrength and violence of any Paſſion whatſoever, may be eſteemed men or true Courage and Fortitude: <hi>Nam impetu quodam &amp; inſtinctu currere ad Mortem, commune cum multis, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberare verò &amp; cauſas ejus expendere, utque ſuaſerit Ratio, vitae mortiſque conſilium ſuſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pere vel ponere, ingentis animi eſt.</hi>

               <p>YET after all if we look into a Chriſtian man as he is propoſed to us in the Goſpel, we may juſtly wonder, to what purpoſe God hath planted in us this Faculty and Paſſion of Courage; ſince the Characters

               <p>TO ſhut up this point; we muſt not be too prodigal of Life, nor trifle it away upon every Occaſion; but we muſt freely expoſe it, when we truly know upon what Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to <hi>ſpare,</hi> or upon what to <hi>ſpend</hi> it: a <hi>violent</hi> Luſt, an <hi>ungovernable</hi> Rage, height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Provocation, or enflamed by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Wine,</hi> may ſo furniſh out a <hi>Hector,</hi> to a <hi>Duel,</hi> and prompt him on to dye,

In outward Shew and Glory <hi>Fortitude</hi> outſhines the reſt; But that which enables and prepares us for all Moral Good,<note place="margin">Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares us for all Moral Good.</note> is in reality <hi>Temperance;</hi> upon this, as upon a ſure Baſis, the whole Building of of a good Life is erected; therefore it is very properly called <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Firſt, BY the way, we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that <hi>Temperance</hi> and <hi>Continence,</hi> which is a part of it, is by Moraliſts taken in a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſignification: When a man hath been an old Offender, hath by long Cuſtom grown familiar with wicked Practices; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that he hath loſt, as it were, all ſenſe of Sinning, or is ſuch a man, as Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines ſay, is hardened; for Hardneſs of Heart, and being given over to a reprobate Senſe, in Divinity, is the ſame with this Senſeleſneſs or Loſs of feeling in Sin, we call ſuch a one <hi>intemperate,</hi> let his Vice be what it will. So the Man that is but a young Offender, he that ſins indeed but

with ſcruple and Reluctancy, him we call <hi>incontinent,</hi> let his Fault be what it will. In Liberality, he that gives, but ſore againſt his Will, we call an incontinent Giver; but ſuch a one, as laſheth out, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſenſe or reaſon is unmeaſureably prodigal, we ſay, he gives <hi>intemperately.</hi>

               <p>THIS we note, that we may underſtand the Language of Moraliſts; otherwiſe <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance</hi> is a peculiar Virtue, and hath its own peculiar Object: <hi>Temperance</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is that Virtue, which teacheth us to keep a moderation in Meats and Drinks, which we call Abſtinence and Sobriety, contrary to which are Gluttony and Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs: <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>NOW ſince every Virtue is converſant in the moderation of two Extremes; of the

one of theſe we cannot doubt, it is ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and ſo often met with; For who knows not Gluttony, and Drunkenneſs; they ſeek no <hi>ſculking Holes,</hi> but tho they are the moſt filthy and ſpotted Crimes, yet every day they dare appear in the face of the Sun. But of the other Extreme we have no Name; it being a thing ſo ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſeen for a Man to offend in the too ſparing uſe of Meat and Drinks; For few there are, that love to give themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way through refuſal of Meats and Drinks; or to do, as that young Man did, of whom <hi>Ficinus</hi> ſpeaks, who languiſhing of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Diſtemper, and being at length told by a skilful Perſon, that there was no Remedy for him but <hi>Marriage,</hi> made choice rather to die, than to uſe the <hi>Antidote;</hi> whence it comes to paſs, that when we meet wtih ſuch a Perſon, we know not what to call him; <gap reason="foreign">

                  <note place="margin">The Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Gift muſt be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</note>Fifthly, WE muſt conſider the quality of the Benefit we beſtow; how well it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits the <hi>Receiver:</hi> For this Reaſon we are to give Cloaths to the naked, Food to the Hungry, Books to the uninſtructed, and Phyſick to the ſick: The ſame good Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple will find out <hi>Workhouſes</hi> for the poor, which is a double Charity; for at the ſame time diligence is encouraged, and a ſupply is adminiſtred.

               <p>IT was a King, who being asked a Penny by a Beggar, anſwered him that a Penny was too little for a King to give; and the poor Petitioner then asking him a Talent, the King replyed, that a Talent was too much for a Beggar to ask: Thus he baſely eſcaped the beſtowing a Gift. Yet thus much by this we learn, that our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits muſt befit the Receiver: For if a Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ask a Sword, we muſt deny him; and if a Perſon in want ask Relief, we muſt give
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:61474:71"/>
it, becauſe our Gifts muſt be always bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial to ſuch, as receive them.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, WE mmſt take great care, with what mind we <hi>give,</hi> and above all we muſt be ſure, that we do it with a chearful Heart: For to give with difficulty and backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is as it were to put Gravel into the Bread we diſtribute, and howſoever neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity forces the poor man to ſwallow it, yet it loſes all pleaſure in the Eating.</p>
               <p>ABOVE all things it principally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns liberal men, to conſider warily from whom they do receive, and whence or from what means they give; For it is a like Theft to receive unlawfully, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfully to give; which is very aptly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in that Proverbial Saying, <hi>were there no Receivers there would be no Thieves.</hi> In the Civil Wars of <hi>Rome,</hi> managed by <hi>Sylla</hi> and <hi>Marius,</hi> according to the manner of Thieviſh War, the Conqueror by Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation gave away the Houſes and Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſuch as were vanquiſhed: But (which was very remarkable) there was not one to be found, who would make an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of theſe Gifts, but all with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>tanquàm à ſacris</hi> abſtained and held their Hands, neither would they receive or touch any thing, that belonged to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,

as if they had been things conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the ſervice of the Gods.</p>
               <p>WHERE ſhall ſome Chiſtians appear when theſe Actions of the Common People of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall come to be examined; when without Scruple they take all things to be good purchaſe, which either their Malice or their Avarice tempt them to receive: This one Example ſhall put to ſhame and confuſion all thoſe, who have taken occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by War or Oppreſſion, by purloin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſeizing upon the Poſſeſſions of the adverſe Party, to relieve their Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary and baſe condition; the very Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Sylla</hi> and <hi>Caeſar</hi> are cenſured by thoſe that report them for rapacious and unjuſt, tho made under pretence of War; and doubtleſs, what is not lawful to give, is not lawful to be received.</p>
               <p>Many other Circumſtances are to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in Giving; As,</p>
               <p>Firſt, IN Giving we muſt be careful not to give of the meaneſt, or refuſe of what we have, but of the better Sort, and ſuch as may be uſeful: For he that gives of the worſt, and reſerves the beſt, hath more regard of himſelf, than of him to whom he gives; whereas a man truly liberal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards not himſelf ſo much as he doth him
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:61474:74"/>
to whom he is beneficial. For the manner of God's Bounty to us ſhould ſhew us the way, how we ſhould be bountiful to others; for God daily loads us with his Benefits; He perpetually crowns us with Loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſs and tender Mercies: Now the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn we are to make for all theſe Favours, for our Health, for our Reaſon, for all the Accommodations of our Bodies, is only to help our poor Neighbour with a little Gold or Silver.</p>
               <p>Secondly, NOT the Greatneſs of the Benefit, but the Ability of the Glver is that which commends the Gift; as in the Caſe of the <hi>Rich Man</hi>'s Offering and the <hi>Poor Widow</hi>'s in the Goſpel; the former gave out of his abundance, which was not in the leaſt diminiſhed by it; the latter gave all, and that with a willing Mind, which did enhance the value of her Gift much above that of the Rich Man.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, 'TIS obſervable that ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who eaſily, as by Gift or by Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance attain to what they have, ſeem to be more liberal, than ſuch, who by their Labor and Induſtry have compaſſed their Wealth: For the firſt of theſe never tryed what Poverty was, never knew the price of a Penny; and hence it comes to paſs,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:61474:75"/>
that they ſo eaſily part with it; whereas thoſe, who hardly gain with great and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Labour, what they have, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly more tenacious, becauſe things got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with the Sweat of the Brow are held moſt pretious, and conſequently are not ſo readily given away: This makes the <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> frugal in ordering his Mony and Expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; this makes him ſo cautious in Buying and Selling, whereby his Mind is inur'd to a great piece of Wiſdom, to eſteem and compare one thing with another, to judg and value not only things neceſſary for the preſent, but all others alſo; for the <hi>Grounds</hi> and Principles of Judgment and Diſcretion are the ſame, though the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,</hi> whereupon they are exerciſed are diverſe: This doth alſo make him orderly and temperate in his Dyet, careful of his Health and Life; while the <hi>Gentleman</hi> is thought leſs cautious and prodigal of all theſe; he eats greedily and ſpends his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny laviſhly, he ſuffers himſelf to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reach'd and thinks he is generous, when he is fool'd by the meaneſt and unworthieſt of the People, impudent <hi>Pedlars,</hi> or flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering <hi>Hoſts.</hi> But it is quite otherwiſe, where Men have and make uſe of the parts God hath given them; they are liberal, but
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:61474:75"/>
it is with Diſcretion, and they are frugal, but without the leaſt ſuſpicion of Avarice.</p>
               <p>WHEREFORE now we ſhould conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a little the Nature of theſe two Vices, that are oppoſite to Liberality, Prodigality and Covetouſneſs. The Nature of which Vices is ſufficiently diſcovered, by that, which we have ſaid of the Virtue, Libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, only this remark ſhould be made, that the Object of Liberality being twofold, <hi>giving</hi> and <hi>receiving,</hi> the oppoſite Vices have parted theſe two betwixt them; the one being converſant in immoderate Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, the other in immoderate ſaving or taking: If we compare theſe Vices ſo as to diſcover which is the worſt,<note place="margin">Avarice is more unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and worſe than Prodiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</note> and of the blackeſt dye, we muſt conclude, that Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice doth far go beyond Prodigality in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitableneſs and miſchief: For all the time the covetous man lives, he is but like a Heap of Dung, which doth no good at all whilſt it lies together; by Death indeed his Wealth is ſpread abroad into many hands, and ſo it falls out to relieve the neceſſities, and to ſupply thoſe, who, out of a vertuous Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are well diſpoſed to do good to others: This may be the Reaſon why the Prodigalare pityed and bemoaned but the Covetous are never thought on without Deteſtation and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:61474:76"/>
Hatred: For other vitious Inclinations com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat Reaſon, and often baffle it, but ſeldom can ſo far vanquiſh it, as that a Man doth applaud himſelf in his Miſcarriages; but the covetous Humour ſeizeth on our Reaſon it ſelf, and ſeateth it ſelf therein, inducing it to countenance and abett, what is done amiſs: The voluptuous Man is ſwayed by the violence of his Appetite; but the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous are ſeduced by the dictates of their Judgments; therefore they hoard all, and will not be perſwaded to part with any thing, becauſe they eſteem Riches the beſt thing in the World, and then they judg themſelves moſt <hi>wiſe,</hi> when they are moſt <hi>baſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are eſpecially of two kinds.</p>
               <p>THE Firſt are thoſe who fail only in <hi>gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,</hi> for whom no man is indeed the <hi>worſe;</hi> yet withal, ſuch they are as for whom no man is the <hi>better;</hi> they are in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance exactly juſt and punctual in their Dealing, and will preciſely give every man his own; but withal they will require their own again with the utmoſt Rigour, without abating the leaſt point: Theſe men, as the World goes, paſs amongſt many for juſt, upright and honeſt perſons; yet to expreſs the badneſs of their Crime, we

call them by ſundry evil Names, ſometimes <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>BUT if we would pleaſe God and act vertuouſly, we muſt demean our ſelves as <hi>Job</hi> did, <hi>Job</hi> 29.11, <hi>&amp;c. deliver the poor that cry,</hi> and <hi>not grind his face;</hi> help <hi>the father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs</hi> and the <hi>Widow,</hi> not exact the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt farthing, they owe; Thus the good <hi>Publican</hi> recommended himſelf to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; <hi>Luke</hi> 19.8, 9. Behold, Lord, <hi>Half of my goods I give to the poor;</hi> Hence He was proclaimed a Son of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation came to his Houſe. So near to the Heart of Piety doth the Holy Scripture lay the practice of Liberality and Bounty; For no Men can be ſaid to be pious, unleſs they be well reported of for good Works; unleſs they have brought up Children, and lodged Strangers; unleſs they have relieved the <hi>afflicted</hi> and <hi>have diligently followed</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very good Deed.</p>

               <p>WE come now to handle that which is the chiefeſt Virtue, the height and perfection of all the reſt, for ſo in truth is <hi>Magnanimity,</hi> if we conſider it aright, and not as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath deſcribed it: There is a Virtue in Chriſtians, whereby they adorn their Profeſſion, which our Philoſopher ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knew not, or he thought it not worth his notice: For Humility,<note place="margin">Humility the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Virtue of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note> which is indeed the greateſt part of <hi>Magnanimity,</hi> is ſo ſcurvily treated by him, as that it finds no place among the Virtues: none of the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers could diſcern its Excellency; becauſe they were a proud and ſelf-conceited Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, and moſt of their Controverſies aroſe from their overvaluing their own Opinions.</p>
               <p>NOW this pure, humble, undefiled Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Mind, by Nature we cannot pretend to, becauſe of the original Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Nature; but by the Grace of God in the Goſpel, we may attain it, and it is the chief deſign of the Goſpel to direct us in the way to it. Although this Humility did generally paſs among the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers in the worſt ſenſe, for a poor ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:61474:84"/>
                  <hi>puſilanimous</hi> Virtue; yet it hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways had an extraordinary Preeminence, not only in Religion, but in the Judgment of all truly wiſe Men, and in all the beſt practice of civil Life: For even in this World, the <hi>dark,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The crafty men fail more in their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns than the honeſt.</note> 
                  <hi>reſerved, crafty men</hi> have fail'd of their Deſigns more than the plain, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right and honeſt men; becauſe the crafty man has many Parts to play, many Minds to put on, many Faces to ſhift; ſo that it is almoſt impoſſible for him ſo to act all, as not to be diſcovered in ſome, and then he will be ſuſpected in all; whereas the honeſt, lowly-minded man has but one part to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, which is his own, and that far more eaſie for him to do, becauſe he always Acts according to the plainneſs and ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Nature.</p>
               <p>THIS Advantage comes by Humility in this life; but in relation to the other ſtate no Virtue is of greater uſe and benefit; for nothing ſhews a nearer reſemblance to the divine Nature, than a mind that is humble and undefiled; nothing manifeſts a greater Conformity to the divine Laws, than a life of Humility and Lowlineſs; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing expreſſes that true and generous Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, which all true Chriſtians have or ſhould have of theſe earthly, tranſitory things;
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:61474:84"/>
nothing declares a more magnanimous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the divine Providence: nothing a more ſubmiſſive Reſignation to the divine Will; nothing a more ſtedfaſt and aſſured Hope of future Happineſs; nothing can keep us ſafer from dangerous Miſtakes in all matters of our eternal concernment: For the humble and candid mind, of which a right Meaſure may ſooneſt be taken, is beſt prepared to take a right Meaſure of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things; that meek and ſincere Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, which leaſt of all deceivs others, is leaſt of all capable of being deceived itſelf, in the ways of everlaſting Salvation: Have not more bold, venturous, artificial Wits fallen into Errors, than they who have been content with the ſteddy, conſtant, and firm motion of meek and humble Chriſtians? For whilſt thoſe preſume all on themſelves, they truſt to the moſt fallible Guide; whilſt theſe wholly ſuſpect themſelves, and implore moſt the Grace of God, they never fail of a certain Aſſiſtance and Direction: And what has been generally the ſucceſs of both? The humble, teachable Temper of the one has produc'd many real Saints, the proud, preſumptuous, ſubtle Spirit of the other has prov'd a fruitful Soil for the Production of Hereticks and Atheiſts.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:61474:85"/>FOR true Humility is the greateſt <hi>Magn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animity,</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf hath by chance confeſſed as much; when in few words he deſcribes a magnanimous man to be him, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, to whom nothing appears great; than which there could not be given a better Definition of an humble man: For as Stout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mind very welll agrees with Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and therefore <hi>Moſes,</hi> who was indeed a Perſon of the moſt undaunted Courage, is ſaid in Scripture to be the meekeſt Man upon Earth; ſo when we have examined all Parties and tryed their Mettal, we ſhall find, that the moſt humble are really the moſt magnanimous; and to be tranſported with the love of Honour, Greatneſs, or the like Follies, tho <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſtood by and frown'd at us, we muſt call it Baſeneſs of mind or Puſilanimity; ſince to ſubmit to that which we ought to contemn, can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve no better a Title, no ſofter a Name.</p>
               <p>BUT that we may throughly underſtand this Point, we will explain the Virtue of <hi>Magnanimity</hi> according to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; and firſt he takes it for a Suppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That Greatneſs is the Object of <hi>Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity,</hi> and therefore he defines a magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous man to be a Perſon that thinks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf worthy of the greateſt things, and is
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:61474:86"/>
indeed ſo: For he who bears himſelf as worthy of great things, but is indeed not ſo, is a Fool, and one in whom Virtue hath no place.</p>

Such is alſo the Title of Knights, who in the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern parts of <hi>Europe</hi> were of the noble Rank, and were in their Youth armed as Martial Knights for the ſervice of their Country; neither among the old <hi>Germans</hi> did any one bear Arms until he was honored with a Spear and Target in their State-Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblys.</p>
               <p>THESE Titles ſeem to be merely great and pompous names, and ſuch as Princes can afford at the cheapeſt rate; yet theſe are thoſe goodly things which beſt pleaſe brave-ſpirited men, and in theſe the Glory of a magnanimous man is eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous.</p>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as it were in love with the Danger; like your <hi>Bravoes</hi> or <hi>Hectors,</hi> as we call them, that are eaſily hired to undertake a Quarrel: Such are in all States with great care to be ſuppreſſed,<note place="margin">Vain-glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</note> becauſe <hi>qui ſuam vitam contempſit Dominus eſt alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae,</hi> having deſperately contemned his own, He makes himſelf Lord of the Lives of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Theſe are the Men, who aſpire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a vain and falſe Glory; therefore in their Words always you will find Oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Inſolency in their Actions; Where as the glory of the <hi>Magnanimous</hi> is ever juſt and well grounded; Hence it is, that they never go about any thing, but what they have power ſufficient to bring to paſs; They fly not to Fallacies or Tricks; are not
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:61474:88"/>
prone to Anger, nor to Boaſting: They are never irreſolute in their proceedings, becauſe they are above thoſe Difficulties, that make deliberations hard; neither will they be at Enmity with Inferiours, nor laugh at the infirmites of other men from any ſenſe of Ability in themſelves.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, HE is no medler in Alehouſe Quarrels, nor in any inferiour Petts among Vulgar Perſons; Whenever He is engaged, it is in ſuch a War, as may bring in the Iſſue Praiſe and Honour; Such as upon which Juſtice and Equity attends; There He hath <hi>par animo periculum,</hi> encounters a danger e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to his mind; He puts no great value upon his own life, but is very well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to lay it down, when it may be for his Countreys ſervice or for his own Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. And in all his Adventures He hath an Eye upon the good and conveniency of of that Party, whoſe Cauſe He undertakes, notwithſtanding for the preſent his Fame and Credit do a little ſuffer: Thus <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius Maximus</hi> refuſed to fight with <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal,</hi> till He was ſure of his Advantage, notwithſtanding the falſe and ill Reports which his Rivals did endeavour to ſpread of him; <hi>non ponebat enim rumores ante ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem;</hi> and in this matter did this Illuſtrious
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:61474:88"/>
Commander behave himſelf with true <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity:</hi> Quite contrary to this Action was that of <hi>Callicratidas</hi> the famous <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daemonian</hi> Captain, who being adviſed in a Council of War to avoid <hi>engaging</hi> the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenian Fleet,</hi> did notwithſtanding run the hazard of fighting and ſo loſt the Day; for which he gave only this Reaſon, That the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> were able to provide another Navy, if they loſt this, but if He ſhould fly, his Honour could in no wiſe be redeemed; Thus a Punctilio of Honour caſt his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try into diſtreſs, and had well near ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it.</p>
               <p>THOSE, who would be thought the only <hi>Heroes,</hi> put a great value upon theſe Punctilio's, in defenſe whereof they are moved by very violent paſſions; but as ſoon as the ſtorm is over, they ſlacken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly of themſelves, if not to the loweſt degree, at leaſt ſo as to be no more the ſame perſons: Inſomuch that upon every triffle they ſhall be provoked to Wrath, and by as little a matter be cooled again; therefore we can never make a right judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Man, unleſs we pry into his common Actions and ſurprize him in his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very-day Habit: Philoſophical diſquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons do not ſo well unfold to us the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:61474:89"/>
of Human Nature, as our own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks would do upon the daily Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Men; For their lives do ſeldom or never correſpond with Speculative Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines: If therefore I behold a Man in the management of his Actions to demean himſelf <hi>ſteddily,</hi> and never to ſtop at any Impediment, that ſtands in his way to a good End; He is the <hi>Magnanimous Man,</hi> whom we enquire after. Some pains muſt be taken to bring the mind to ſo conſtant a Reſolution; But when once it is confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nothing ſhall diſcompoſe, nothing ſhall ſhake it:<note place="margin">The beſt ſeaſon for the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</note> Therefore the beſt Seaſon for the exerciſe of <hi>Magnanimity,</hi> is in the time of hardſhip and Affliction; when, as a Tree planted in Winter, it will thrive better, than in the warmth, or in the midſt of thoſe Delights, that are taſted in the Ages of Peace and Plenty: Nay, when Affairs are drawn to the very dregs of <hi>Malice,</hi> a Man fortified with this Virtue, will look upon all its Stings, as unpoiſonous, though they are ſharp; whatever ſevere Conflicts we may have with the thoughts of Death, the Feaſt of a good Conſcience, and the Wall of a judicious Conſtancy will fence us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them: This is the greateſt glory of a Chriſtian to ſubdue the Burdens of Life,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:61474:89"/>
while we are deprived of <hi>health, liberty, power, ſafety, or Eſtate;</hi> by the Virtue of <hi>Magnanimity</hi> all this may be done, which is the greateſt honour of our Lives, and the beſt improvement of our Deaths: We muſt acknowledg, it is not eaſie to contend with the many dangers, loſſes, diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and troubles we meet withal in this Life; yet this <hi>Heroick greatneſs of Spirit</hi> will ſo patiently ſuſtain them all, that they will afford much ſweetneſs at the laſt, and bring a Crown at the end of the Race.</p>

               <p>Firſt, BECAUSE the Magnanimous man in his behaviour with others carries his love and his hatred openly and in his hand; For the cauſes of either of them being juſtifiable, he cares not, who ſees them; his Love He will not conceal, becauſe his Friend may not ſuſpect, that he hath any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation to him; neither will he hide his Hatred or diſlike, becauſe the Soul there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by may be ſtained with the moſt venomous malice, as the Diſeaſes, that proceed from <hi>Stoppings,</hi> are the moſt miſchievous to the Body.</p>

But if a Man hath that piercing Judgment, which the Virtue we now treat of, will produce, He will diſcern, what things are to be laid open; what are to be kept ſecret, and what are to be ſhewed at half-lights, to whom and when; Theſe are the Arts of State, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> calls them, and theſe are the Arts of Life: But Nakedneſs is uncomly, as well in the Mind, as in the Body, and it addeth no ſmall reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to men's Manners and Actions, if they be not altogether open: eſpecially the diſcovery of a man's ſelf, by the tracts and lines of his Countenance, is a great betraying, becauſe his Face is frequently more taken notice of and believed, than his Words: In ſhort, the <hi>magnanimous Man</hi> will never act the Hypocrite, becauſe
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:61474:90"/>
it is a Vice, that riſes either from natural falſeneſs or fearfulneſs, whereby a man is deprived of one of the moſt principal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments for Action, which is <hi>Truſt and Belief.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, HE is not apt to wonder at every thing; For what can ſuch a one ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire at, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Fourthly, HE abhors that ſecret Spight, which we ſee to be in moſt men, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they make the good Names of others the ſubject of their Table-talk, miſreport

Humour, that maketh men active and ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, but very troubleſom and uneaſie to all about them; 'tis true, to forbid a Soldier the uſe of it, is to pull off his Spurs; but if it gets into the ruling Seat, it can never keep things ſteady; having not that Ballaſt of temperate and ſober Wiſdom, without which the Ship of the State will roul too much, and be in danger often of overſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, becauſe the Counſel, that is to direct it, is too haſty and precipitate.</p>

                  <note place="margin">With whom we may, and with whom we may not be Angry.</note>AS firſt, The cauſes of our Anger muſt not be ſlight and eaſie, but juſt and of ſome importance; either the Service of God, or the violation of the Laws of our Country, the wronging of our Parents and Family, the taking away our good Name; theſe or the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:61474:96"/>
like occaſions may move us to Anger and juſtifie it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, WE muſt conſider the Perſon, with whom we are angry; For we may not lawfully be angry with God or our Parents, with our Maſters, Friends or Companions, with thoſe that teach and admoniſh us, or with thoſe in eminent Place, that are to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern us: Whenever ſuch unjuſtifiable An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſeizes us, its motions are ſo violent, that they ſhake the very principles of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and will not permit us to do any thing, that is Chriſtian-like or manly: But if we are guided by the Rules of true Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and peaceable Wiſdom, we ſhall be angry with none but wicked men; then our Anger will be called <hi>Zeal,</hi> and that with Virtue and Underſtanding.</p>
               <p>ONE thing by the way it may not be impertinent to give warning of, that we be angry eſpecially in ſuch caſes, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern us, and in which we have power to pardon or forgive.</p>

pardoning injuries done to others, who call upon them for Juſtice. But this is a foul miſtake and very prejudicial to Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; For Magiſtrates are in This like pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men; They are then merciful, when they forgive Injuries againſt; themſelves: when they do the like in miniſtring Juſtice for other men, it may be ſome inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate pity, but mercy it cannot be.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">What the temper of our Anger muſt be.</note>Thirdly, THE third thing to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered is the Temper of our Anger; how far, and how much we are to allow to our ſelves in the caſe of Anger; we may not let looſe the Reins, but keep it within due bounds, and not be difficult in forgiving ſuch as have offended us, conſidering our own manifold infirmities; This is the Way to vanquiſh all the Sratagems and Conflicts of <hi>Malice;</hi> But whoſo does any thing in the firſt kindlings of Anger, He is ſoon miſled into the moſt deſperate precipices of Action; To remove this Evil, We muſt ſuffer our Paſſion to take vent and cool it ſelf; For to fly out into the heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Adventures of Revenge and Outrage at the firſt inſtant as it were, hath preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced otherwiſe very good Men; When <hi>Theodofius</hi> therefore, a Prince of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Virtue and merit, had much overſhot

himſelf upon ſudden Wrath, Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> adviſed him ever after that to rehearſe the Alphabet, before He ſuffered himſelf to proceed in his Choler; that He might gain time thereby to weigh the reaſons of his Wrath, and ſo might have an opportunity to prevent the breaking out of ſo dangerous a Fire.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">What time our Wrath may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue.</note> A fourth thing to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered is the time of our Wrath; How long we ſhould ſuffer it to depend; For long Anger grows ſour, and is eaſily turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Hatred, which of all Vices hath in it the moſt Venom and filthineſs: For if Charity be the principal of all Virtues; then certainly, Malice is the principal of all Vices, as being moſt contrary to Charity; The Maſter of the Sentences had a Conceit, that Charity was the very Eſſence of the Holy Ghoſt, and that He really dwelt in our Hearts, when this gift of Charity was infuſed into us; I verily ſuppoſe He was deceived, but he ſaid enough to make us believe, that <hi>Malice</hi> is that great Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, which at no time ſhall find Remiſſion.</p>
               <p>ABOVE all things therefore we muſt be wary, how we ſuffer our Anger by long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it to degenerate into the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:61474:98"/>
Sin of Malice: For Moroſeneſs, a pettiſh Humour, or whatever perverſneſs there is in our Natures, are nothing but the Ways and ſteps unto Malice, a Vice, by ſo much the more to be avoided, becauſe it is one of thoſe Sins, of which Men ſeldom or never repent them; as it is in the caſe of Avarice and Ambition, which after they have taken root, are ſeldom or never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved by Repentance. The Apoſtle there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to cure the miſchief, which may come of long preſerving our Anger, confines it to one day; Let not the Sun (faith he) go down upon your Wrath; And the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture exhorts us all to poſſeſs our Souls in <hi>patience;</hi> as if He, who is out of <hi>patience,</hi> was out of the poſſeſſion of his own mind, and acted, as the Bees do, <hi>animaſque in vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere ponunt.</hi>

               <p>MANY other Particulars there are in common life,<note place="margin">We muſt not be fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in Company.</note> in which we are to watch over our Anger; as for Example, When we are diſpoſed to harmleſs Mirth, if we are fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the whole Entertainment is ſpoiled; ſo bitter Words break to pieces the love and kindneſs of good Converſation; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Anger makes a man unfit for Society, becauſe it will force him to reveal Secrets, and fits thereof deſtroy the Methods of

               <p>SOME of theſe Rules perhaps might have been ſpared; For ſo we do that, which becomes us, and as Reaſon doth direct, it matters not, tho we never be in a Paſſion; for uſually when it hath raiſed our Blood to a greater Fermentation, than ordinary, we forget our ſelves, and do more harm, than good, according as it is written in St. <hi>James</hi> 1.20. <hi>The wrath of man worketh not the Righteouſneſs of God:</hi> Neither is there any paſſion, that ſo much tranſports men from their right judgments, as Anger; ſo thought <hi>Plutarch,</hi> whoſe Opinion hath ever been taken for juſt and true, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly where he judges of <hi>human</hi> Actions; But <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſays, it ſerves for Arms to <hi>Virtue;</hi> yet they, who contradict him, ſay, it is a

us the means, whereby we may enjoy a peaceable life in the midſt of all the Changes and ſtorms in Human Affairs: Which at firſt looks ſtrange, when every man ſeems to be engaged in ſome Faction or other; When Animoſity and ill Will do bear down all before them: For there is in moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons a certain intemperance of Paſſions, that renders them very obnoxious to fall into theſe Vices; Which paſſions are chiefly the <hi>deſire of Honour,</hi> the <hi>deſire of Riches,</hi> or <hi>the deſire of Revenge;</hi> If a Man conſiders, how the publick or the particular concerns of the World are carried on, He will ſee, it is done by ſetting of <hi>handles</hi> to theſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers in mankind; by which they are directed and led like Puppets on a Stage, by unſeen Wires; ſo that their motions are not from themſelves, but are managed by others, that either wiſely or craftily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Objects to theſe unruly paſſions; then they begin to think that they need not run the long Race of Virtue, to attain Honour; nor the tedious application of themſelves to ſome Calling, to make them Rich, nor the regular motion of a judicial Proceſs, to avenge their Injuries: Nay, ſuch is the Enchantment, that ariſeth from theſe intemperances of the mind, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

any ſolicitation from abroad, they drive men headlong that Way, they think the ſhorteſt, to ſatisfie themſelves: But ſuch is the Conſtitution of a meek or a moderate Man, that none of theſe Diſtempers dwell in it; therefore He is proof againſt all their temptations; to this end He avoids ſuch things, as may procure Envy or Emulation againſt him; Envy being <hi>an affection,</hi> that hath vehement Wiſhes; and whereas there is an occaſion given of moving other Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections but now and then, this of Envy is the moſt continual and the moſt importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; it keeps no Holy day, but is ever at work upon ſome or other; and all the while it is the vileſt Affection, and the moſt proper Attribute of the Devil; to fly the Poiſon of this moſt depraved Vice, the Man of that good temper, we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing, is never covetous of great Offices, affects not Grandeur or Popularity, is fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal in his Entertainments and manner of living, is ready to help not only his Friends, but He is a Benefactor to Human Nature, whenever He ſees it in diſtreſs.</p>

                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:61474:102"/>NOW the Paſſions may be divided into two kinds; ſuch as are more violent and unnatural, referring to Evil, as <hi>Anger, Fear,</hi> and <hi>Grief;</hi> Others more natural and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, relating to that, which is good, and conſequently they are more agreeable to our deſires, as <hi>Love, Hope,</hi> and <hi>Joy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE firſt of theſe are curbed by a <hi>meek</hi> and <hi>gentle Spirit;</hi> the other are ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and confirmed; and both ways our quiet is much promoted: For ſuppoſing we pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice <hi>meekneſs</hi> in all matters of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie,<note place="margin">Paſſions are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded beſt by a meek Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</note> we ſhall thereby be inclined to judg ſoberly, and lovingly to accommodate all things: For ſuch a prudent relaxation of the utmoſt rigour, as right Reaſon ſhall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, according to the variety of Caſes and Circumſtances, will beget peace to ones ſelf and the reſt of mankind.</p>
               <p>SUPPOSING our minds be thus tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd to mildneſs in the midſt of troubles, loſſes, and diſappointments; then theſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils will not be only leſs bitter to us; but we ſhall be able thereby to overcome the Evil and turn it to a good uſe, and to the fortifying our Spirits againſt the difficulties, that are to be undergone in the courſe of a virtuous Converſation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:61474:103"/>BESIDES all this it is the peculiar pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg of a <hi>meek Man,</hi> to have his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation in Heaven, while he dwells upon Earth; It is true, no man's mind is in this State ſo well framed, as fully to underſtand the happineſs of the other; but this we may be ſure of, that the peaceable and <hi>meek Man</hi> is beſt prepared for it, becauſe our Souls muſt continue for ever; What we make them in this World, and ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſition of mind, as we carry with us out of this State, we ſhall retain in the next; For He, that <hi>is filthy, will be filthy ſtill,</hi> and He, that is <hi>unrighteous, will be unrighteous ſtill:</hi> In a place therefore of happineſs and purity there can be no room for fierce and unruly Paſſions, becauſe they would not only make us miſerable, but be a trouble to all thoſe, with whom we ſhould Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe; For if a Man of a malicious and peeviſh Temper ſhould enter the Manſions of Bliſs, he would not only be unhappy himſelf, but He would raiſe ſtorms even in thoſe calm Regions; he would be like the Rich man in Hell, tormented with a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Thirſt, and burnt up in the flames of his own ardent Deſires.</p>
               <p>VAIN Man! that dreameſt of being happy, without any diſpoſition for it; To
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:61474:103"/>
be happy, is to enjoy what we deſire, and to live with thoſe, whom we love; But there is nothing in Heaven ſutable to the deſires of a turbulent Man; all the Joys there are purely Spiritual, and are only to be reliſhed by thoſe, who are <hi>meek</hi> upon Earth, and have <hi>purified themſelves, even as God is pure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE hope therefore of that plentiful Inheritance,<note place="margin">Meekneſs is the moſt proper di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſition of mind for eternal Happineſs.</note> which God hath prepared for them, in whom there is the ſame mind and <hi>ſpirit of meekneſs, which was in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> ſhould inſpire us always with new vigour in the ways of Virtue and Holineſs; This very thought ſhould confirm all purpoſes of Obedience; For if we have our <hi>fruit unto holineſs,</hi> our end will be <hi>everlaſting Life:</hi> For the other State was ſo unknown to mankind, that they knew not, what Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions and Habits would qualifie them for it; before they were declared by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, who came from thence, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently underſtood beſt, what were the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary preparations for it; Though many Virtues, which he hath enjoined us may ſeem unneceſſary reſtraints of our Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; yet we ought to conclude, that He knew the reaſon of ſuch Commands, and that ſuch qualities will be found as needful
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:61474:104"/>

               </p>

               <p>IN the whole courſe of our Lives no Virtue is of greater uſe, none deſerves more regard, than this eſpecially in common Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; wherein the occaſions of <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending</hi> and <hi>reproving</hi> do often occur, and this Virtue teacheth us how to commend without Flattery and to reprove without Bitterneſs: Indeed to praiſe men in their own preſence is very ſeldom neceſſary; they can do it faſt enough of themſelves, and many can ſcarce forbear doing it, tho it be nauſeous to the Company, with whom they Converſe:<note place="margin">Flattery is an odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thing.</note> The leſs need there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall we have to ſpeak much of that,

               </p>
               <p>IN Converſing with our <hi>Betters,</hi> we muſt beware of Sawcineſs, or of uſing our advantage if we have any; For it is a true Proverb, <hi>He that eats Pears with his Betters, muſt take heed how he chooſe the beſt.

               <p>Secondly, OUR behaviour amongſt our equals muſt be without all Imperiouſneſs; for Inſolence and Statelineſs are no ſigns of a well bred Man, but the Scandals of Converſation; and it being better to give too much Honor to any Perſon than too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; therefore it is better to carry our ſelves as inferiours to our equals, and equal to ſuch, as are not much our inferiours.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, WE muſt ſo Converſe with our inferiours, as never to do any thing that may look like ſcorn; becauſe Man by Nature is moſt impatient of Contempt:<note place="margin">Man na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally is muſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient of c<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>TO conclude, in our behaviour with all kind of Perſons, we muſt cut off thoſe Angles, and ſmooth all that roughneſs, which may give offence; and be cautious, that we fall not upon either of the extremes, <hi>baſe Submiſſion,</hi> or <hi>Surlineſs;</hi> for theſe are the Two Rocks, between which we muſt ſteer our Courſe, if we would adorn the Doctrine of Chriſt with a blameleſs Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:61474:108"/>
that we may be good company for our Neighbours; for hereby our words are made more gracious and acceptable, our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits more quick and pleaſant, our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances more ſmooth and obliging: A Temper thus Framed, may ſupport the Burden of Life very contentedly; which is not unfitly compar'd to a <hi>Journey;</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it <hi>all alone</hi> is ſo uncomfortable, that we ſhould grow weary, as ſoon as we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin it, unleſs we were joined in friendſhip with our <hi>Fellow-Travellers,</hi> who will make it ſeem leſs tedious and burdenſome: What a comfort is this to humane Life! to walk with ſuch Companions, as ſhall aſſwage our cares with their wholſom Diſcourſes, diſpatch our Counſels with their ſage Opinions, and diſſipate our ſorrows with their innocent Mirth: Therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> hath told us, that <hi>two are better, than one;</hi> 1. <hi>In the Caſe</hi> of inward Weakneſs, if <hi>one fall,</hi> the <hi>other will</hi> lift up his Friend; 2.

too corroſive and ſharp; the reading <hi>Books of Morality</hi> is often very flat and dead; and the obſerving our faults in others, is frequently unproper for our caſe; but the <hi>beſt Receipt,</hi> both for the amending our Manners, and the managing our Buſineſs, is the <hi>Admonition of a Friend;</hi> eſpecially when he is one of real worth, having a Mind furniſhed with treaſures of divine Wiſdom, and a Heart <hi>full of the Love</hi> of God: For the Hope neither of gain, nor pleaſure, nor youthful affection, but the Love of Wiſdom, Goodneſs, and Sobriety muſt knit us together; we muſt be united by the admiration and eſteem of the ſame things; for ſince the Study of Virtue is not ſubject to thoſe changes of Fortune, that other things undergo, the benevolence of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Men muſt needs be perpetual, and is not in danger to ſuffer that decay, which is wont to be the Fate of <hi>vulgar Friendſhip.</hi>

               <p>FOR there are many examples of Men, who are ſatisfied with the knowledg of their own good Parts; they have a Treaſure of Learning lock'd up, and they care not to diſcover it to their own great diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.

               <p>WHEREFORE if I can make it out, when Facetious Humours are allowable, and when they are Wicked, and not to be endured; I ſhall be able to ſhew a Man, how to get the Reputation of a Wit, and of one, that is both Good and Wiſe too: 'Tis true, there is nothing,<note place="margin">Men dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer much in their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Wit.</note> that men differ more in, than in determining, what Wit is; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they place it in Words and Phraſes; ſometimes in Appoſite Tales; ſometimes it puts on the dreſs of <hi>Similitudes,</hi> or is wrap'd up in humorous Expreſſions; ſometimes it is lodged in a ſly Queſtion, or a ſharp Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partee; ſometimes a tart Irony goes for Wit, or a big Hyperbole; In ſhort, No Man can give a reaſonable account of its Ways, becauſe it doth anſwer to all the numberleſs Rovings of men's Fancies, and to all the <hi>turns</hi> of their Language.</p>
               <p>IT will be therefore very hard to ſettle a clear and <hi>certain Notion</hi> hereof, ſo as to make a Virtue of That, which appears in ſo many <hi>ſhapes;</hi> that we may as well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine

               <p>THUS we may render <hi>Facetiouſneſs</hi> a Virtue; but as it is commonly uſed, it is far from being ſo; Sundry Authors, as <hi>Tully, Quintilian,</hi> and others of a later Stamp, have framed us an Art of <hi>Jeſting;</hi> which if any one thinks fit to ſtudy, He may <hi>learn</hi> the <hi>Times, Places, and Perſons,</hi> where and with whom <hi>jeſting</hi> is comely: If then a Perſon will keep himſelf from <hi>buffoonery,</hi> abſurd, or ſcurrilous Jeſting on one hand, and on the other from clowniſh <hi>and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handſom</hi> Diſcourſe, they praiſe him for a Wit, and a pleaſant Companion, one, that knows fairly and without offence to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; And it is <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s greateſt Reaſon

make Sacred Perſons and Things ridiculous, are not infinitely ſo themſelves? It is true, the World is much taken with this ſort of Ribaldry, and commends the man, who is skill'd in it, as a good Companion; but in ſtrictneſs of Life and Virtue we may not ſo account of it; <hi>&amp; nobis alii rarò, &amp; nos aliis nunquam riſum pariamus,</hi> is the good Council of <hi>Picus Mirandula;</hi> and it is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in charge preciſely by the laſt Canon of the third Council of <hi>Carthage; ſi quis Clericus aut monachus verba ſcurrilia &amp; jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culatoria riſumque moventia loquetur, acerri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mè corripiatur.</hi>

Wherefore that Religion, and Reaſon may well agree in the caſe of <hi>facetiouſneſs;</hi> that it may not tranſgreſs the limits of Sobriety and be conſiſtent with the tenour of a Chriſtian's Duty; that it may not fall under St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Cenſure of <hi>fooliſh talking and jeſting, which are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient;</hi> We may conclude, that ſuch <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetiouſneſs</hi> is not unlawful, as affords harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Delight to Converſation; becauſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity is not ſo harſh an Inſtitution, as to forbid mankind wholeſom and uſeful Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; <hi>or ſacrificing to the Graces,</hi> as the Ancients call'd it, when it expoſes all wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and baſe practices to due Contempt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is expedient, that Vices ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ridiculous to the whole World; For ſome Perſons are ſo temper'd, that they are ſooner <hi>pleaſed</hi> or <hi>vexed</hi> into better Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, than they can be prevailed upon by

but only that our wretched Lives ſhould paſs the eaſier and the happier for that little time we poſſeſs them, or elſe end the better, when we loſe them: Upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion Virtues came to be admired, becauſe they are the beſt means to this End: He therefore muſt bid defiance to mankind, muſt condemn their univerſal Opinions and Deſigns, if inſtead of practiſing theſe Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues with conſtancy and courage, He ſhall offer to ſneak out of the Field, and by too much <hi>baſhfulneſs</hi> betray the Fort, that He ſhould maintain againſt the aſſaults of Vice.

                  <note place="margin">What it is, to rule the Tongue.</note> is to weigh and conſider, what we are about to ſpeak; and to reſtrain our ſelves from uttering that, which upon conſideration we find is not fit to be made known; And be we never ſo paſſionately earneſt to eaſe our Minds; yet we muſt chuſe rather to offer the greateſt violence to our Paſſions, than give our ſelves leave to ſpeak that, which ſober Conſideration and ſound Chriſtianity do not allow of: Both which do principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly charge us to ſpeak nothing, when we are urged to ſpeak much, or to ſpeak gently and wiſely, when our Paſſions would move us to ſpeak at <hi>random.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THEREFORE we muſt bridle our Tongues eſpecially from meddling with theſe five things: 1. <hi>Vanity.</hi> 2. <hi>Swearing</hi> and <hi>Curſing.</hi> 3. <hi>Lying.</hi> 4. <hi>Flattery.</hi> 5. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach</hi> and <hi>Scoffing:</hi> For by theſe Evils moſt of the miſchief, that is in the World, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted; He, who babbles that, which is <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>trivial,</hi> is altogether uſeleſs; and He, who ſpeaks that, which is <hi>falſe,</hi> is very deſtructive at leaſt to himſelf; He, who
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:61474:128"/>
Flatters, abuſes his Friends with <hi>falſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances</hi> and <hi>feigned Speeches;</hi> He, who Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, wounds his Neighbour, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates the great Duties incumbent on us, <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice</hi> and <hi>Charity;</hi> He, that <hi>ſwears,</hi> profanes God; which is a certain ſign of a vain and light Spirit, that conſiders little, and cannot diſtinguiſh Things.</p>
               <p>TO the Queſtion, Why we ought to <hi>bridle our Tongues,</hi> I ſhall anſwer in two Inſtances.</p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>NOW if a Man doth not conſider what He is to ſay, in ſome meaſure he ſpeaks, he knows not what; how great a Folly is it, to offer that to the judgment of others, whereof a Man hath made no judgment himſelf; to ſpeak Words, and expect the Hearer ſhould put Senſe into them, though the Speaker intended none! Whereas weighty and deep Senſe lies low and deep in the mind, is not eaſily and readily drawn out; Wiſe Sayings and Sage Counſels do not dwell upon the Tip of the Tongue; they do not edg and fringe our Lips: they do not guſh out like pent-Waters, but ſpring
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:61474:128"/>
gently and eaſily drop by drop; So the heavieſt Bodies lie neareſt the Centre; Gold and Silver are in the hidden Mines of the Earth, while dirt and mire cover its Face; So the Treaſures of the Sea ſink to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, while Foam ſwims aloft, like unto which are <hi>raſh und haſty Words,</hi> that knock at every Ear, that importune every Man, that ask and anſwer every Queſtion; They are the <hi>Scum</hi> of an empty Mind, the very froth of an unſetled and uncompoſed Spirit.</p>
               <p>WHEN therefore I ſee a Man ſwell with Pride and Scorn, with Envy and Wrath, ſaying, This Man hath no Religion, and the other knows nothing of the <hi>Power of Godlineſs;</hi> This is a <hi>Formaliſt,</hi> and That an <hi>Hypocrite;</hi> this is <hi>Ignorant,</hi> and the other meerly <hi>Moral;</hi> I can no more think him to be a good Chriſtian, than I can believe Scorn to be Piety, Bitterneſs to be Love, or Fury to be Patience.</p>
               <p>WHEN I ſee a Man haunt Atheiſtical Company, hear him Rioting in Wine, when vain Diſcourſe fills his Mouth, and Trifles wag his Tongue, as puffs of Wind ſhake the leaf of the <hi>Aſp;</hi> when uncleanneſs flows out of his Belly into his Mouth; I muſt needs think, that his Heart is full of theſe Fornications, which have debauch'd his
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:61474:129"/>
Tongue, and that all theſe Evils are painted tot he life in his impure Fancy, which hede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes in his Diſcourſe;<note place="margin">Men will be judged of accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their words.</note> Wherefore let a Man ſpeak, as He would be thought to be; For whatever ſlight Thoughts any man hath of his Words, others will paſs Sentence on him according to them, and the leſs he conſiders them, the more they will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered by others, and that to his ſhame, and to the diſgrace of that Religion, which He doth profeſs.</p>

Then if you enquire into the reaſon of theſe inordinate Heats, and unchriſtian Diſtempers; you will find, they began thus, this Neighbour ſpoke contemptibly of the other, and He returned the Scorn again; then mutual Scorns beget mutual Grudges, and God knows, where thoſe Grudges will end; For He that draws the Sword, muſt as we uſe to ſay, throw away the Scabbard; So He, that ſpeaks a raſh Word, little knows the offence He may give, what jarrs he may kindle, and how far, or how long they may be propagated: For commonly men entail their Quarrels upon their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and following Generations inherit the the Animoſities of their Anceſtors, and Children ſtudy to Revenge their Parents ſufferings: Hence come endleſs Suits at Law, and hence proceed many bloody Duels; For how many have loſt their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates to ſatisfie a Paſſion!

               </p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:61474:133"/>Firſt, WE ſhould conſider, that it is our chief buſineſs to reform our <hi>ſelves;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Our chief buſineſs is to amend our ſelves.</note> For the <hi>Phariſee</hi> is not amended by accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Publican;</hi> nor the <hi>Publican</hi> by find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fault with the <hi>Phariſee;</hi> but the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee</hi> and <hi>Publican</hi> both by condemning <hi>themſelves;</hi> Therefore we ſhould always, when we are inclined to condemn others, think thus with our <hi>ſelves;</hi> Do we acquit our <hi>ſelves</hi> by accuſing them! Do we reform our <hi>ſelves</hi> by correcting <hi>them!</hi> Are we the more Innocent, by pronouncing others <hi>guilty!</hi> Do we find our own Corruptions abated, by ripping up thoſe of other men! If it be not thus, what have we been doing all this while? We have forfeited our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in God, and our Title to the Name of Chriſt; and there are none ſo free to meddle with other men, as they who moſt of all neglect <hi>themſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, WE ſhould conſider, that a Man is never qualified to reform others, till he hath in the firſt place <hi>amended him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;</hi> For let a Man but look into his own Boſom, it will like the <hi>cleareſt Glaſs</hi> reflect upon him the exact Images and proportions of his <hi>Virtues</hi> and <hi>Vices;</hi> the only fear is, leſt this Mirrour ſhould be any ways crack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and flawed by Self-love, mingled with
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:61474:134"/>
other untoward Paſſions, that do ſo cloud the mind with <hi>prejudice,</hi> that it cannot take due meaſures, and underſtand it ſelf aright: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, a Man thus blinded, is ſo far from being ſenſible of his own imperfections, that He takes thoſe very Defects often for good and great Accompliſhments; which makes him judg, He hath no faults, when he hath as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, or more, than other men. Thus a Man is the worſt Neighbour to himſelf, when he is ſo partial a Judg of his own Actions, as quite to overlook his <hi>Errours,</hi> or to miſapprehend them for <hi>Virtues:</hi> But he is fitteſt both to reform himſelf and others, who with an impartial and ſevere Judgment makes a ſtrict enquiry after what is amiſs at Home, and will not ſuffer any fondneſs to himſelf to miſguide him in the Examination; For after that Self-love, Envy, Pride, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and Flattery, thoſe malignant Humors, are purged out of the Heart; He may ſafely be admitted to judg of other men; For knowing well, what he himſelf is, his Charity in judging others will be ſuch, as will bear all things: Inſtead of ſpreading ill Reports, He is in nothing more buſie, than in ſtopping the Current of them, and in preventing as much as he can, whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will prove miſchievous to Human So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety:
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:61474:134"/>
Not that he doth,<note place="margin">None are obliged to ſpeak well of all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, or Things.</note> or ought to think well of all <hi>Perſons,</hi> or ſpeak well of all <hi>Things,</hi> but He thinks and judges of things, as they are, being always directed therein by Charity and Prudence: For if a good Man ſhould not condemn things as bad, and faulty, which are really ſo, he will be in ſome caſes thought <hi>treacherous</hi> or <hi>cowardly,</hi> when He dares not reprove Evil for fear of ſome diſpleaſure; In other caſes an Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite or a Flatterer, when He paſſes by or commends that, which his Conſcience doth not allow of.</p>
               <p>THE beſt Method any one can follow, to avoid theſe Extremes, and to go through the World with an unblameable Credit, is never to ſuffer the Mind, whoſe thoughts are ever at work, to ſtart out into <hi>wanton</hi> Imaginations, ſo as to make him a Tatler, or a Buſie-Body, but with conſtancy to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply his whole Soul to the examination of his own Ways, which is the ſureſt and beſt courſe to guide our Judgments aright; which when <hi>David</hi> did, he preſently turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his <hi>Feet to God's Teſtimonies.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Our words muſt be accounted for to God.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, WE ſhould conſider, that all the Words, which our Tongues have utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as well as whatever our Hands have acted muſt be accounted for to God; And
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:61474:135"/>
if we do but reflect upon the Frame and Temper of our own Spirits, we cannot but conclude from thence; that every one of us muſt give an account of his own Actions, and the Judgment hereafter ſhall paſs upon us according to that Account: For every Man's Soul hath a Conſcience belonging to it, and whereſoever this Conſcience is, it giveth teſtimony to this <hi>Truth;</hi> As we hope therefore for Salvation at this great Day, let us ſet a <hi>Seal</hi> upon our <hi>Lips,</hi> becauſe by our <hi>Words we ſhall be juſtified,</hi> and by our <hi>Words we ſhall be condemned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WHEREFORE, A Man who would live, as He is obliged by the Precepts of <hi>Virtue,</hi> muſt take care,</p>
               <p>Firſt, THAT he does not miſtake the place of his Religion, ſo as to be buſie in the Lives of Others, and negligent of his own, that He do not with Zeal cry down the Evils of the Times, and yet practiſe thoſe Evils, which He condemns.</p>
               <p>Secondly, THAT he do not miſtake the Power of Religion, as if it meant no more but a bare <hi>profeſſing to be religious;</hi> this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion makes ſome men contented, that their ſins ſhould be expiated by Chriſt's Blood, but they care not for having their Paſſions ſubdued by his Spirit: they are
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:61474:135"/>
ſo far from it, that they do not think, that this is intended in his Goſpel, or that it is poſſible to be done.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, THAT He do not miſtake a part of Religion for the whole; as if God could be indented withal for a Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in ſome parts of Chriſtianity, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence for his Zeal and Activity in others.</p>
               <p>FOR if a Man profeſſes Religion, and yet doth not <hi>bridle</hi> his <hi>Tongue;</hi> We may infer, that He doth not look upon his Religion,<note place="margin">Every Man ſhould take care, that his Religion be practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.</note> as an Obligation upon him to reform his Life: Whereas if we would take, as we are bound, the meaſures of our Religion ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Victories we have gained o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver corrupt Affections, and according to the Graces of the Goſpel, which we have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; it would abate a great deal of that confidence and Pride, that is in the World; For then every one would take care, that his Religion be practical; then all men would believe, that nothing can make them truly religious, that doth not conform them to the Life and Spirit of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> then they will not take that for Chriſtianity, which doth not either ſubdue ſome known Luſt, or conform them to ſome known Law.</p>

Divine Providence, that made Nature, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for all and every individual of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, muſt become utterly unattainable; Hence it is, that few men care to live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and thoſe, that do it, are either Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage People, or they are diſcontented, and the humorous: But men generally are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered into Commonwealths, and the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer Companies of them are divided into Towns or Cities; who are all thus met to comfort one another with <hi>mutual Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and <hi>mutual Help.</hi>

who thinks himſelf bound to maintain the common Right of all, and to ſecure his Neighbours happineſs, as well as his own; For if Juſtice be not ſuppoſed to be the Law of our Natures, no <hi>Covenants</hi> can be of power enough to bring us under any Obligation to it; But this is a moſt certain Truth, that all men have a natural Right to Happineſs from the very deſign of their Creation; that this cannot be acquired with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mutual Aids and Friendſhips; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore right Reaſon dictates, that every man ſhould have ſome concern for his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, as well as himſelf; becauſe this is made neceſſary to the welfare of the World, by the natural ſtate of Things, and by this mutual Exchange of Love and Kindneſs men ſupport one another in the comforts of Human Life.</p>

               <p>NOW this is an exact Rule; and it is plain and eaſie: Many men cannot find out what the Law is, or the Right in ſuch a Caſe; it is ſo entangled in long and intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Rolls of Parchment; many men cannot deduce the Laws of Nature one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but there is no Man, but can tell, what it is, that he would have another man do to him; every one can take his own actions, and put them into the other Scale, and can ſuppoſe, if this, that he does now to another, were to be done to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſhould he be contented with it: And thus by changing the Scales, the very Self-intereſt, which makes a man Covetous, and inclines him to injure another for his advantage, makes him likewiſe unwilling that another ſhould wrong him.</p>
               <p>IT muſt be confeſſed in matters of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract and Commerce; many Queſtions ariſe, which it is hard for one to decide, who is unacquainted with theſe affairs, the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of things, or the hidden reaſons of ſome
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:61474:141"/>
kinds of dealing: However this is a general Rule, in making Contracts we muſt deal fairly and truly; in performing them we muſt ſatisfie the engagements,<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs or ignorance are not to be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon.</note> we have made; for ſo we would have all Mankind to treat us: Hence we are obliged not to impoſe upon any Man's ignorance or unskilfulneſs; we may ſet a juſt value up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Goods, but we are not to ſet a Price upon another man's Head, nor to Tax his ignorance; therefore no advantage muſt ever be made of Children, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther incompetent Perſons: And it is ſinful to diſparage another man's Commodities, or to raiſe our own above the truth, that we may thereby lead a man into errour, or draw on a Bargain the more eaſily.</p>
               <p>MATTERS of rarity and fancy have no certain Eſtimation; therefore we muſt be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate in the price that we put upon them; ſo much the rather, becauſe in theſe things we are left to be our own Judges, Neither ſhould we venture ſo far, as to go to the utmoſt limits of what is Lawful; for he, that will walke upon the very brink, the leaſt ſtep awry will tumble him down; ſo he, who will do the utmoſt of what he may do, will ſometime or other be tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to what he ſhould not act; for it is a
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:61474:142"/>
ſhort and eaſie paſſage from the edges of what is lawful, to what is unlawful and evil; Therefore in that latitude which Trad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men have of Gain, they are bound by this Rule of Juſtice to ſhew favour to the Poor and Neceſſitous; to practice Ingenuity towards the ignorant or unskilful, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration towards all Men.</p>
               <p>WHERE they have any doubt about the equity of their dealings, they ſhould chooſe the ſafeſt part; for not only a good Conſcience, but a quiet one is to be valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above Gain; therefore in Matters of Duty they ought to do the moſt; in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions of Right and proportions of Lucre, where there is any Diſpute, they ought to <hi>chooſe the leaſt;</hi> for this is always the ſafeſt courſe: Now the circumſtances, that vary Caſes, are infinite; ſo that when all is done, much muſt be left to the equity and chancery of our own Breaſts: Neither can it be determined, how much a Man may get in the Pound and no more; for he may make a greater Gain at one time, than another, of the ſame thing; he may take thoſe advantages, which the change of things, and the Providence of God gives him; he may take more of ſome Perſons, than others; provided, he uſe all men righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:61474:142"/>
he may uſe ſome favorably. I ſhall not deſcend to any more Particulars on this Head; for the ſake of Sir <hi>Thomas More</hi>'s Obſervation of the Caſuiſts in his time, that they did not teach Men not to Sin, but did ſhew them, how near they might come to Sin and not commit it.</p>
               <p>THE ſecond Species of particular Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, we call Diſtributive Juſtice,<note place="margin">Diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſts due Rewards and Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhments.</note> which is concerned in adjuſting due Rewards and Puniſhments; and in dealing with every Man according to his deſert: For many Men doing the ſame thing do not deſerve alike; great Perſons and private Men, carry not away the ſame reward of their Actions: The Husbandman ſells his Corn at the ſame Rate to the Prince and to the Beggar; but the ſame Action of the King, and of the mean Perſon, is not rewarded in the ſame meaſure: Seeing therefore do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Juſtice is nothing elſe, but dealing equally with all Parties as near as we can, that all things may come to equality, or which is the ſame, to equity, we are to obſerve, that there are two ways, which we are to take in all our Actions, of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Juſtice:</p>
               <p>Firſt, ONE is called <hi>medium Rei,</hi> which is always the ſame, and is that <hi>medium
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:61474:143"/>
Arithmeticum,</hi> which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and other Moraliſts talk of at large.</p>
               <p>Secondly, THE other is <hi>medium rationis vel proportionis</hi> and is called <hi>medium Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metricum,</hi> which is not always the ſame, but varies according to <hi>perſons, times, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions,</hi> and other <hi>circumſtances.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>NOW the principal thing, which is to be reſpected in the doing Juſtice; is that, which we call equity;<note place="margin">How E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and Juſtice differ.</note> as it ſtands in oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the rigour or ſtrictneſs of Law. And here we muſt obſerve, that there is ſome difference between Juſtice and Equity; tho ſometimes they are put together and are taken for the ſame thing; what the Laws and common Reaſon will allow, that we call juſt; but equity conſiders the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the Caſe, and will grant al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance, if they do require it; for equity doth moderate the Rigour of the Law; ſometimes there may be, what is juſt, and no equity in the Caſe, but ſometimes there is both juſt and equal in the ſame matter; now whereſoever there is equity againſt ſtrict Juſtice; there equity ought to take place:</p>
               <p>AND when we conſider, how much we are beholden to the Mercies of God for our Being and daily Maintenance; we ſhall
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:61474:143"/>
not think it ſafe to appear in the defence of ſtrict Juſtice, not to ſtand upon all,<note place="margin">Strict Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice not to be ſtood upon.</note> that the rigour of the Law can deſire; For this is the Apoſtles Rule, <hi>Let your moderation,</hi> that is, your Clemency and Compaſſion <hi>be known unto all men;</hi> it being a Habit, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a Man is enabled and inclined to deal according to the equitable ſenſe of the Law, and is placed betwixt the two Extremes, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> Rigour, or <hi>ſummum jus</hi> on the one hand, inſiſting too much on the Letter, and <hi>relaxatio nimia,</hi> remitting too much from the true ſenſe of it on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide; Now both theſe Extremes, the exceſs and the defect being evidently Vices, it muſt follow, that the <hi>Medium</hi> betwixt them muſt be a Virtue, and have in it the Obligation of a Duty.</p>
               <p>AND if we do not act, as it commands us; we ſhall not only depart from the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of a Chriſtian Spirit, but we ſhall take ſuch a courſe, as that a cancell'd Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation may return upon us, as it did upon that wicked Servant in Saint <hi>Matthew;</hi> who, becauſe He did not forgive his Brother a ſmall Debt, after his Lord had ſo freely forgiven him a great one, was afterwards taken and caſt into Priſon, becauſe he had not compaſſion on his Fellow-ſervant, as his Lord had pity on him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:61474:144"/>IN all our humble Applications to God Almighty we both hope and pray, that He would <hi>not be extreme to mark, what we have done amiſs,</hi> but overlook our manifold Infirmities; And I dare ſay, He is very unmindful of Humane Nature it ſelf, who can harden himſelf againſt all Compaſſion to his Brethren, when at any time they are miſtaken or ſurprized.</p>
               <p>THEREFORE let Juſt and Equal be thus ſtated; What common Reaſon or the letter of the Law will admit, may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted <hi>juſt;</hi> but <hi>equal</hi> conſiders all Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and allows for Errours or any unavoidable Accidents; <hi>To be juſt,</hi> is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean our ſelves according to the Laws of the Place, wherein we live; <hi>To be equal,</hi> is to conſider all things, that are reaſonable, and to act accordingly.</p>
               <p>FOR this temper of Mind will render us gracious and merciful; conſequently moſt like unto God, who is <hi>juſt and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in all his ways, full of mercy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion;</hi> For it is every ones Tenure and ſecurity; where this Virtue doth not take place; there will be nothing but Fraud and Cozenage, and every man will be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe; it ſupports Human Society, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe would ſoon fall into Strife and
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:61474:144"/>
confuſion; it is agreeable to the principles of our Natures; We were made to theſe things, and we force our ſelves, and offer violence to our Faculties, whenever we do an unjuſt Action, that is cruel or unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous: It is the Right of every caſe, and a man's greateſt Wiſdom is ſeen in finding that out, and his goodneſs, in complying with it; And if we keep to this Rule of doing always what is Right and Fit, we ſhall be juſtified, whenever we are ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned to give an account of our Actions: we ſhall be delivered from the ſeverity of Puniſhment, the end of which is either to <hi>ſupport</hi> Right, or to <hi>be exemplary,</hi> that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may be withheld from following bad Examples; In fine, the practice of this Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue will remove from us all ſuſpicion of Arbitrarineſs; which is the fouleſt Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, that can be put upon any man, that he affects to maintain <hi>Self-will;</hi> but to live in the <hi>practice of Equity,</hi> gives eaſe to the Mind, and to do thus is ever well-pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſight of God.</p>
               <p>WHEREAS He, who is diſpoſed to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the heels of the Law, <hi>may,</hi> as the Proverb warns him, have his Teeth ſtruck out, For <hi>Summum jus eſt ſumma injuria;</hi> upon many emergent and unforeſeen occaſions,

and as the circumſtances of things alter, ſo doth the Law; and many times it ſo falls out, that whoſo keeps moſt ſtrictly to the letter of it, is in danger of committing the groſſeſt Iniquities.</p>
               <p>HITHERTO we have placed the whole ſum and ſtreſs of <hi>Common Juſtice</hi> in theſe two words, <hi>Suum cuique;</hi> yet it is moſt true, that He, who puts into a Madman's Hand his <hi>own</hi> Sword, is certainly the mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Perſon of the two: To murther ones own Siſter, or Mother, is the blackeſt Crime, and the moſt Savage of any, man can be guilty of; yet <hi>Horatius Cocles</hi> and <hi>Oreſtes</hi> deſerved their Pardons: Thus a thouſand Circumſtances may ariſe to mollifie the four Precepts of the Law; by reaſon of which its ſtrictneſs, may in ſome caſes be diſpenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with.</p>
               <p>WHEREFORE in many Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, Law and Equity have diſtinct Courts, and Supreme Powers have always challenged a Prerogative to temper the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of Laws; and the Style of the <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery</hi> Court in <hi>England</hi> is <hi>Teſte me ipſo;</hi> by which the Prince reſerves to himſelf the moderation of the Law; therefore it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the King's Conſcience,</hi> tho in the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Chancellour. And it is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:61474:145"/>
neceſſary this ſhould be ſo, that through a dark and long Journey full of Briars and Brambles, we may at length come at <hi>Equity;</hi> For Law ſuits muſt be uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, ſo long as the Lawyers ſeek not for their Judgments in their own Breaſts, but in the Precedents of former Judges; as the Ancient Judges ſought the ſame, not in their own Reaſon, but in the Laws of the Empire; beſides there is ſcarce any thing ſo clearly written, that when the cauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is forgotten, may not be wreſted by an <hi>Ignorant Grammarian</hi> or a <hi>Cavelling Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,</hi> to the injury, or the deſtruction of an Honeſt Man.</p>
               <p>THIS hath made <hi>Juſtice</hi> appear ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed a thing;<note place="margin">The reaſon why Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice hath appeared ſo perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> the mighty Commentaries upon it have brought a Cloud upon that, which elſe would ſhine forth in all the brightneſs of Truth and Sincerity: Thus the Scripture it ſelf hath ſuffered by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, and the ways of <hi>Juſtice</hi> by the craft of Advocates and Clerks have been made to look like thoſe of Fraud, myſterious and crooked: Thus <hi>Judgment</hi> is turned into <hi>Wormwood:</hi> for it is embit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by <hi>injuſtice,</hi> and <hi>delays</hi> make it ſour.

of Mankind, to be born free from all Duty and Morality: Thus they ſlander Human Nature, and make a <hi>Villain</hi> of it.

               <p>MOREOVER, If the real Obligation to obey the Laws of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> be only from the Fear of <hi>puniſhment,</hi> then might men juſtly break any Laws, for their own advantage, if they can reaſonably promiſe themſelves <hi>Impunity:</hi> And whenever they have Power, they may oppoſe Civil Authority, which according to this <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> is an <hi>artificial thing</hi> and nothing elſe but <hi>Force:</hi> If it be

               <p>BY the way, I have often wondered, how Juſtice eſcaped out of the number of Intellectual Virtues; for it hath very little in it, why we ſhould account it among the Morals; ſince it is not converſant in the moderation of any Paſſion, or in hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Mediocrity betwixt two extremes, which two things formally conſtitute every Moral Virtue; but every Act of it is pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Rational, and partakes little with the ſenſitive Part: But thus it hath pleaſed our great Maſters in this Faculty, we now ſpeak of, to range the Virtues; and having Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed of Juſtice among the Morals, we

               <p>NOW we enter the <hi>Work-houſe</hi> of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, where Art manages all the Tools and Materials; and in Humane Life, we are much more beholden to thoſe, who invented <hi>Plowing</hi> and <hi>Sowing,</hi> than we are to the finer Wits,<note place="margin">The work-houſe of Virtue.</note> who have conveyed to us nothing but the abſtracted Ideas of Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and the aiery Notions of Metaphyſicks; which are like the curious Argumentations, concerning quantity and motion in natural Philoſophy; if they only hover aloof and are not ſquared to particular Matters, they may give an empty ſatisfaction, but no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, and rather ſerve to ſwell, than fill the Mind: But whatever we ſee in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or Houſes, above the firſt Wildneſs of Fields, the Meanneſs of Cottages, and the Nakedneſs of Men, muſt be aſcribed to the Works of Art: Therefore we are now to ſhew, how excellent and uſeful Virtue is, in the Eſtabliſhed ways of Life: For altho the Studyes of Men are various, according to the difference of thoſe Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,

ſtead of that; there is no compaſſing the end we aim at, by fraudulent and indirect courſes, but only by juſt Dealings and honeſt Counſels.</p>
               <p>SO that if that be true, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly obſerved, that Men are wont to prove ſuch kinds of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as they were <hi>Men</hi> before, and that Converſion does not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy, but exalt our Tempers; it may well be concluded, that the diligent Man in his Employment, is nearer to make a modeſt, and an humble Chriſtian,<note place="margin">The dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Man makes the beſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</note> than the Man of Speculative Science, who is proud of his Knowledg; for a true Preparation for the next Life, is not at all inconſiſtent with Men's conſulting of their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in this World, or being employed about Earthly Affairs; the honeſt purſuit of the neceſſaries, and of the conveniences of a mortal Condition, by Juſt and regular Ways, is by no means contradictory to the moſt real and ſevere Duties of a Chriſtian; it is true indeed, an irregular proſecution of Profit or Gain, is an offence to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; but ſo it is alſo to Right Reaſon, and Nature it ſelf: And it is a wrong Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the State of Grace, if Men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that when they enter upon it, they muſt preſently caſt away all the thoughts

and deſires after the Poſſeſſions of this World; but when we are bidden not to <hi>think our own thoughts,</hi> it is not intended, that we ſhould forbear all natural Actions and Inclinations; ſo it muſt be lawful for the ſtricteſt Chriſtian, by the help of honeſt Arts, to provide for the neceſſities of this Life; elſe the condition of Men would be worſe, than that of the Beaſts, that periſh; ſeeing to them it is natural to ſeek out for all the ways of their own preſervation.</p>
               <p>IT muſt be confeſſed, that there may be an <hi>exceſs,</hi> as well as <hi>defect,</hi> in men's O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions of Holineſs; and then I will make no Scruple to ſay, that the virtuous Man defiles not his Mind, when he labors in the works of an honeſt Art to advance his profit;<note place="margin">Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves of the works of honeſt Art.</note> the diverſion it gives him, will ſtand with the greateſt conſtancy, and the delight of purſuing it, with the truth and reality of Religion: Which is indeed an Heavenly Thing, but not utterly averſe from making uſe of the Rules of humane Arts; wherefore it is not the beſt ſervice, that can be done to Chriſtianity, to place its chief Precepts ſo much out of the way, as to make them unfit for Men of buſineſs, whereas the beſt part of Religion is Practical, and Her chiefeſt Precepts are thoſe, that
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:61474:151"/>
govern the private Motions and Paſſions of our Minds; thoſe are its moſt excellent Rules, which calm our Affections and Conquer our Vices; And the works of practical Religion are no leſs wonderful, than thoſe of Art, which we now ſpeak of; for in whatever place of the World Arts have been deſtroyed,<note place="margin">Barbarity prevails when Arts are De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.</note> Barbarity hath prevailed; inſomuch that if <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> and <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> ſhould now ariſe in Greece again, they would ſtand amazed at the horrible Devaſtation of that, which was the <hi>Mother of Arts,</hi> and at the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance as well as incivility, that hath taken its ſeat: And if <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſhould return to Life, they would ſcarce believe this <hi>Britain,</hi> and <hi>Gaul,</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> to be the ſame, which they deſcribed; they would now behold 'em covered over with Cities and Palaces, which were in their time overrun with Forreſts and Thickets; They would ſee all manner of Arts Flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing in theſe Countries, where the chief <hi>Art,</hi> that was Practiſed when they Lived, was that Barbarous one of <hi>Painting their Bodies,</hi> to make them look more Terrible in Battel.</p>
               <p>HENCE it is remarkable, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Arts have been Plante,d there Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,

               </p>
               <p>NOW then it is required in that <hi>Study,</hi> which ſhall attempt according to the force of Nature,<note place="margin">The Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of the mind cured by buſineſs.</note> to cure the Diſeaſes of the Mind; that it keep it from <hi>idleneſs</hi> by full and earneſt Employments, and that it poſſeſs it with innocent, various, laſting, and even ſenſible Delights: therefore where Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry and Trade do fill the Thoughts, as it does the whole Soul of the People in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
                  <pb n="255" facs="tcp:61474:153"/>
you ſhall find none of thoſe Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, that infect the minds of the Slothful and unactive; Strangers among them are apt to complain of the <hi>Spleen,</hi> but thoſe of the Country ſeldom or never; which I take to proceed from their being <hi>ever buſie,</hi> and eaſily ſatisfied; For this ſeems to be the Diſeaſe of People, that are <hi>idle,</hi> and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to all men at one time or other, from the Fumes of indigeſtion, from the common alterations of ſome inſenſible degrees in Health and Vigour; or from ſome changes, or approaches of change in Winds and Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which affect the finer Spirits of the Brain, before they grow ſenſible to other parts; and are apt to alter the ſhapes or colours of whatever is repreſented to us by our Imaginations, whilſt we are ſo affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; yet this effect is not ſo ſtrong, but that Buſineſs or intention of Thought, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly either reſiſts or diverts it: but ſuch as are <hi>idle,</hi> or know not, from whence theſe Changes ariſe, and <hi>trouble</hi> their Heads with Notions <hi>and Schemes of general happineſs or unhappineſs</hi> in Life; upon every ſuch Fit they begin reflections on the condition of their Bodies, their Souls, or their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes; And as all things are then repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in the worſt Colours, they fall into
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:61474:154"/>
melancholy Apprehenſions of one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſometimes of them all; theſe make deep impreſſion on their minds, and are not eaſily worn out by the natural returns of good Humour: But this is a Diſeaſe too refined for a People, whoſe Heads are bent upon laborious <hi>Arts;</hi> they are well, when they are not <hi>ill,</hi> and pleaſed, when they are not <hi>troubled;</hi> they ſeek their happineſs in the common Eaſes and Commodities of Life; never amuſing themſelves with the more Speculative contrivances of <hi>Paſſion,</hi> or <hi>reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of Pleaſure.</p>

would improve their time much better, and exerciſe a far more uſeful <hi>Art,</hi> in ſtudying how to order <hi>Timber</hi> better, <hi>harden Stone, improve Mortar</hi> and <hi>make firmer Bricks:</hi> If men would be perſuaded to follow the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial Arts of Life, and not be guided by vain Fancies, we ſhould not be ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed, as we are, by <hi>Gaudineſs</hi> and <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity;</hi> ſo debauched by <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>NOW then I will proceed to exhort the Man who hath moſt leiſure to proſecute earneſtly all the uſeful <hi>Arts of Life;</hi> and for his Encouragement in theſe Ways, I will briefly lay down before him the Advantages He will gain by them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, THE uſual courſe of Life of the <hi>Gentleman</hi> eſpecially in <hi>England</hi> is ſo well placed, like <hi>Virtue</hi> between two <hi>Extremes,</hi>

<pb n="258" facs="tcp:61474:155"/>
Country a quieter <hi>Hemiſphere,</hi> and a clearer Air for that purpoſe; if they will obſerve the generations of living Creatures, their Stables and their Ponds, their Parks and their Kennels will give 'em Eternal matter of Enquiry: If they would advance their Fruits or their Plants, then the Paſtures and Orchards, the Groves and Gardens furniſh them with perpetual Contemplations. And from their Sports, Hunting, Hawking, Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Fowling, they may receive as much ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Profit, as they do Delight.</p>
               <p>FOR if the <hi>Gentleman,</hi> who is ſo much at leiſure, can be brought to the love of ſome <hi>Art</hi> or <hi>buſineſs,</hi>

may then believe. that their preſent <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> cannot be maintained by intemperate Pleaſures, or the gaudy ſhews of Pomp, but by true Labours and induſtrious Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; and if we enquire into the Ways of <hi>Life</hi> of ſome of the Greateſt Men, that have lived in times paſt, we ſhall find, that amidſt the Government of Nations, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch of Armies, and noiſe of Victories, ſome of them diſdained not to <hi>work with</hi> a Spade, to dig the Earth, and to cultivate with triumphing <hi>Hands,</hi> the <hi>Vine,</hi> and the <hi>Olive.</hi>

               <p>HENCE we may infer the neceſſity <hi>of a Calling</hi> in all Orders of Men for their better leading a profitable and virtuous Life; For Man is very active by Nature, and if He hath no Vocation to buſie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in, he muſt needs be doing ſomewhat, that is Evil; as in the caſe of <hi>lazy Monks</hi> and begging <hi>Fryars,</hi> thoſe <hi>ſlow Bellies,</hi> who by their <hi>unlawful Vows</hi> and <hi>affected poverty</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all honeſt Induſtry, and enrich them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves not only with the <hi>Widows Houſes,</hi> but with the fatteſt Lordſhips of a Country; or in the caſe of thoſe, who think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves priviledged from taking pains by their <hi>Birth, Breeding,</hi> and <hi>Eſtates;</hi> by which means their whole Life is ſpent either in doing nothing, or that, which is worſe:

Now theſe Perſons ſhould look into the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories of their Anceſtors, and obſerve by what ſteps they raiſed their Houſes to the height of Gentry, or Nobility; it was done either by <hi>ſerving in the Camp, ſweating at the Bar, waiting at</hi> the <hi>Court, adventuring on the Seas,</hi> or by <hi>bartering in the Shop;</hi> If it be ſo, then they uſurp their <hi>Arms,</hi> if they do not inherit their <hi>Virtues:</hi> And if Mankind would judg truly of their Condition, as to the account they muſt give to God of their ſeveral <hi>Talents,</hi> the conſideration of their <hi>works</hi> rather, than of their <hi>diſpoſitions,</hi> will afford 'em the beſt Aſſurance; becauſe their Gifts and Abilities both of Body and Mind, being <hi>in the brain</hi> or <hi>hand,</hi> are at a greater certainty, than their Inclinations, which are ſeated <hi>in the Heart,</hi> that is <hi>deceitful above all things.</hi>

               <p>WE are therefore to enquire, what this <hi>Prudence</hi> is by which we muſt guide our Affairs; in general this may be ſaid of it; that it is that Virtue, which muſt go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern all the reſt; to which they owe their

               <p>Secondly, IF a Man doth not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate proper Means for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Noble End, he ſtarves his Cauſe and declares, that he doth not know the <hi>worth</hi> of his <hi>own Deſign;</hi> ſo that his propoſing a good End, is more by Chance than Election; when he hath not <hi>Prudence</hi> to follow this End with fit and ſufficient Means.</p>

<pb n="267" facs="tcp:61474:159"/>
to encreaſe his Eſtate; And as He, who hath an Ambition to be highly honoured or prefer'd, will take care to offend no Body, but demean himſelf Civilly; will put up and conceal many Affronts; will do all acts of <hi>Courteſie</hi> and <hi>beneficence,</hi> that He can; As another, whoſe <hi>Genius</hi> leads him to ſearch for <hi>Knowledg,</hi> knows the <hi>directeſt way</hi> to it is <hi>ſedulous Study,</hi> to peruſe good <hi>Books,</hi> fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent the beſt <hi>Company,</hi> and to render all uſeful to himſelf by <hi>ſober Contemplation:</hi> So the <hi>prudent Man</hi> in Virtue aims at the Enjoyment of God's Favour and <hi>Eternal Life</hi> with him; therefore He applies him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf heartily to the fitteſt Means for this End, which is to be <hi>holy,</hi> and to <hi>do good;</hi> to ſerve God faithfully, and to make uſe of all Opportunities of <hi>redeeming</hi> his time; therefore thinking much of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and hoping to land himſelf <hi>ſafely there,</hi> He will never <hi>ſteer</hi> his Courſe by a <hi>falſe Compaſs,</hi> by imagining, that he is in the <hi>right way,</hi> when he is of ſuch a Party, when He can diſpute hotly for this and that Opinion, or when He ſpends all his Zeal upon thoſe things, that <hi>periſh in the uſing,</hi> and never go beyond this preſent State: As the <hi>pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Man</hi> for this World doth not content himſelf with chuſing proper Means to <hi>the

Ends,</hi> he follows; but when he is ſatisfied that the Means, he hath choſen, are fit and ſuitable, he is never diſcouraged or baffled out of them by any difficulties whatſoever; For inſtance, No hardſhip diſheartens the Man, who deſigns to get Riches; He ſlights all the Labours and Cares in his Way, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is ſtedfaſtly bent upon the acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of his Deſires; And as another Man, who is ſtrongly inclined to become Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in all ſorts of Learning, and to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand all Matters, that have been before him, knows well, that his Candle muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver go out; that by <hi>pains</hi> and <hi>watchings</hi> he muſt contract pale Looks, and a ſickly Body; yet he is not caſt down by any of theſe conſiderations: So the <hi>prudent Man</hi> in the buſineſs of Virtue, is ſure, that if he doth <hi>good</hi> and lives <hi>well,</hi>

<pb n="269" facs="tcp:61474:160"/>
Counſel of a Man, whom he thinks not to be Honeſt, or that he imagins, will impoſe upon him: So the <hi>prudent</hi> Perſon for the cauſe of Virtue, builds his Faith and Hope for a better World with as much care and caution; therefore He is not apt to be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by every Impoſtor, but contemns thoſe Mountebanks in Religion,<note place="margin">A Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent man is not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily miſled.</note> who by fair Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and ſpecious Gulleries, <hi>wheedle men</hi> out of their Senſe and Reaſon: This he doth, becauſe He is as careful of his Religion, and as watchful againſt Cheats, as the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning man for this World is wont to be for advancing his ſecular Ends and Intereſts: For which purpoſe he will watch the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Seaſon of doing any thing, and will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver let it ſlip; So the <hi>prudent Man</hi> in the Warfare of <hi>Virtue</hi> lays hold of all oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities for the benefit of his Soul; He makes uſe of the preſent time, and conſiders, if his Work be not done now, it will never be done at all.</p>
               <p>So far the <hi>Parallel</hi> goes between a <hi>pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Man</hi> for this World and for Virtue; But here we cannot but bewail the ill State of things, that Men ſhould ſtrive to be more diſcreet in the little Affairs of this Life, than they are in matters of much more importance to them; the unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableneſs
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:61474:161"/>
of which will appear in theſe four particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt it is manifeſt,<note place="margin">The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of being more pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent for this world, than for virtue.</note> that a good Man hath a nobler End to purſue, than the Men of this World can pretend to; for how low a deſign is it! how unworthy a rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Being, to heap up Wealth, when he knows not how ſoon he may be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from it, or that waſte away and leave him: With an ambitious Perſon it is juſt ſo, he hath laboured all his days to become Great and Honorable; when he hath ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected it, his Name is only toſſ'd too and frô by the envy of the World; but ſuppoſing that Riches could be durable, or that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor were a certain thing; yet the Poſſeſſions of this Earth in their moſt flouriſhing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, are not to be compared with the enjoyments of a virtuous Man; which are chiefly, to have peace with God, and with his own mind; Now if a Virtuous Man hath a greater and more deſirable End of his Actions, it is very unreaſonable, that he ſhould be outdone in prudence or care, in the working out his Salvation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As a virtuous Man hath the beſt end, ſo the means, that he hath to it, are much more certain, than all the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of the World are: For <hi>Solomon</hi> hath
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:61474:161"/>
aſſured, us that here the Race is not always to the ſwift nor the Battel to the ſtrong; one in all likelihood would think, that the ſwifteſt <hi>ſhould winn the Race, and the ſtrongeſt, the Battel;</hi> yet the wiſeſt Man, and the beſt Judge of the true valuation of all things below, hath determined quite otherwiſe; the beſt humane means, tho never ſo well fitted to their ends, do often miſcarry; for after a Man hath run the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt dangers, and hath ſpent his life in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual care for an abundance of Worldly Goods; a <hi>thouſand accidents</hi> may and do fall out to deveſt him of it; when ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath uſed all his Art and Wit to build up a reputation, a <hi>vulgar breath</hi> ſhall blaſt it all: Whereas the means, which the <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> of Virtue uſe to their end, will never fail them; for never any one was diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of a peaceable Mind, who ever was ſo prudent, as to manage the courſe of his Life <hi>by the Rules</hi> of Virtue; never any failed of the Favour of God, who had ſo much diſcretion, as to obey his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; nor did ever any miſs of Eternal Life, who were ſo wiſe for themſelves, as to labor after it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, THERE is no more difficulty in the means of obtaining the reward of
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:61474:162"/>
Virtue, which is both preſent and future Happineſs, than there is in thoſe ways, which the crafty Men of this World uſe to bring their deſigns about; therefore it is ſtill more unaccountable,<note place="margin">It is eaſier for a Man to be vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, than viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</note> that they ſhould take more pains in their way, than the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>Virtue</hi> do in theirs; beſides it is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten much more difficult to raiſe a credit in the World, than it is to get the Favour of God, or that Peace of Conſcience, which a conformity to the Precepts of Virtue will certainly afford us: Health of Body is not acquired <hi>without</hi> warineſs and continual cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection; it is far eaſier, for a Man to entertain himſelf in virtuous Contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for God hath not ſet our happineſs at difficult terms; but the way to it is ſmoother, than we are apt to imagine; it being as eaſie to be ſober, as to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; to be juſt, as unrighteous; the Rules of Virtue are not ſo rigid, as Men uſually apprehend them to be; therefore it is the moſt unpardonable folly, if they be not as induſtrious in the practices of Virtue, as they often are in the proſecution of vitious and naughty Purpoſes.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, BY being diligent and diſcreet in the exerciſe of moral Virtue, we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſecure the happineſs of this preſent
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:61474:162"/>
World, as well as the next, the better to our ſelves; for the Men, who regard only this World, may be ſure, that they ſhall not <hi>find any felicity in a</hi> future Life, becauſe they have <hi>taken no care about</hi> it, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently they loſe this World alſo; For if they follow <hi>Shadows,</hi> they muſt needs loſe the <hi>Subſtance;</hi> but if they lay faſt hold of the Subſtance,<note place="margin">The pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Man is ſure of the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs both of this and the other World.</note> they muſt conſequently poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs the Shadow; by which I mean, that if they would be wrought upon to lead a virtuous Life in good earneſt; they would not only ſecure their Intereſt in another World, but they would ſucceed better in the Affairs of this; For, ſo our Saviour hath ſaid, <hi>ſeek ye firſt the Kingdom of Heaven and his Righteouſneſs, and all other things ſhall be added unto you:</hi> Therefore let us be Wiſe, and make <hi>Virtue,</hi> our main deſign, becauſe length of days is in her <hi>right hand, and in her left Riches and Honour;</hi> For God doth often diſpenſe the common Benefits and good things of this Life to the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, over and above what he intends to beſtow upon them in the World to come.</p>
               <p>SEEING then <hi>good Men</hi> have the beſt End to follow,<note place="margin">The Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Man always follows the beſt End.</note> the moſt apt and certain means, that always prove effectual; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:61474:163"/>
there is no more difficulty in attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Heavenly, than earthly things; ſeeing that men do uſually ſecure a competency of the things of this World, by mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the things of another; but if we place all our Affections upon this World, it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times falls out, that we are fruſtrated of what we deſire; Therefore let us en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to be as <hi>prudent</hi> at leaſt in our way of Piety and Virtue, as Worldly-mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men are in theirs; From whoſe Saga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city we may learn to forearm our ſelves againſt the wiles of the Tempter; For when all is done, <hi>true Wiſdom</hi> is gotten only in the Word of God, becauſe that <hi>makes us wiſe unto Salvation;</hi> and they are <hi>very Fools,</hi> who never think, what miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs will come upon them, after they have ſpent a ſinful and ungodly Life; they ſeem not to be diſtinguiſhed from Brutes, who care not, what they do, or what becomes of them, provided they can fulfil their fleſhly Luſts; it is quite otherwiſe with a <hi>good Man;</hi> his End is <hi>Eternal Life;</hi> the means he takes to it is an <hi>upright</hi> and <hi>vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Converſation,</hi> which will never fail of its Rewards.</p>
               <p>NOW the oppoſites to true <hi>Prudence</hi> are Craft, or a <hi>fraudulent ſubtlety,</hi> and <hi>folly;
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:61474:163"/>
Craft,</hi> my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> ſays, is a ſiniſter and crooked Wiſdom; and certainly, there is a great difference between a Cunning,<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a crafty and a prudent Man.</note> and a Wiſe Man, not only in the point of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, but in Ability; For there are thoſe, who can pack the Cards, and yet they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not play them <hi>well;</hi> So there are ſome, who are very Quickwitted at Tricks and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients, that are otherwiſe weak and ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Men: their great Engine is a <hi>ſmooth Tongue</hi> and a competent ſtock of <hi>Wit;</hi> in general Expreſſions, they pretend much Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and Kindneſs; to gain their Ends, they will uſe many Artifices, as taking ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of Perſons in Neceſſity, that are under ſome fear of Puniſhment, or of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery; that are in Danger, or blinded with Paſſion; that are Weak or Ignorant, Inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertent or Eaſie; they watch their time to enſnare, and exert all their Power to impoſe upon them: Thus they build their Houſe under ground, as it hath been obſerved of the Crafty, <hi>celant, tacent, diſſimulant, inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diantur, praeripiunt hoſtium conſilia;</hi> and in order to their own advantage, they look upon all other men, as Enemies; neither have they, or ever intend to have any Friends.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="276" facs="tcp:61474:164"/>WHAT an odd, as well as wicked Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour is this <hi>Guile,</hi> as if by the help of the moſt perverſe and the moſt erring Guide a man might find out ſhorter Ways, than the <hi>lawful Road,</hi> leaping over Hedg and Ditch; breaking through <hi>all legal Bounds;</hi> as if the moſt crooked were the readieſt Way to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at their Journeys End: This is that, which the <hi>Serpent</hi> is ſaid to be eminent for, above all other Beaſts of the Field;<note place="margin">What Craft or a Serpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is.</note> whence it is commonly called a <hi>Serpentine Wiſdom,</hi> that lies ever upon the Catch, and deals by way of Stratagem: In a ſtate of War perhaps it may be allowable, as it was thought by <hi>Virgil,</hi> when he asked; <hi>dolus an virtus, quis in Hoſte requirit?</hi> Yet even in War its ſelf, where matters depend upon ſudden Actions, a brave and generous Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my will make as little uſe of the <hi>Dolus</hi> or Craft, as may be: Therefore to uſe it in their ordinary carriage or dealings with their Brethren; to make them ſuch promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as they will not be obliged by; to ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Words, that intend nothing; will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe men to others, with whom they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, as dangerous and unworthy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p>THE deficient <hi>Extreme</hi> of <hi>Prudence</hi> is called <hi>Simpleneſs</hi> or <hi>Folly,</hi> which conſiſts in

                  <note place="margin">The pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Religion is a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition for Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note> As God hath made the practice of Religion a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Condition of our Happineſs; ſo the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing doth make it a neceſſary condition for it; For our utmoſt Happineſs being to conſiſt in the enjoyment of God, and it being impoſſible that Perſons ſhould have communion one with another, that are not of a temper; we muſt be like to God, if we would be Happy; Now nothing can make us like unto God, but Holineſs and Virtue: Therefore Men are not wiſe, who think, they can be partakers of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs upon any other account; Knowledg indeed it ſelf is a Divine Perfection, but yet that alone doth not render a man like to God, neither doth that alone qualifie him for his Preſence; For if a Man had the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of an Angel, he might for all this be of a <hi>devilliſh</hi> Temper, and whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is ſo, hath no diſpoſition in him for the place of pure Happineſs.</p>

               <p>ALL that we have to do is, to obey his Commandments, and this is the beſt way to encreaſe our knowledg in Religion; For the practice of a Trade ſhall give a Man a truer knowledg of it, than reading all the Books, that ever were writ about it, and ſo we ſhall better know a Countrey by travelling into it, than by poring upon all the Maps, that ever were made of it: In like manner Obedience to the Will of God doth diſpoſe us for the knowledg of it, by freeing our Minds from prejudice, by making our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings more clear, and taking away the great Obſtacles of Wiſdom; which without the practice of Religion will be ſo far from being any furtherance to our Happineſs, that it will be one of the ſaddeſt, and moſt unhappy aggravations of our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery: For when we come into the other World, no reflection will more enrage our Torments, than to think, that we choſe to lead vitious Lives, and to make our ſelves miſerable, when we knew the way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

               <p>A Manifeſt decay hath been brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Moral Virtue;</p>
               <p>Firſt, BY Hypocriſie or Formality; when Men follow a Form of Godlineſs, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Power thereof.</p>
               <p>Secondly, BY Licentiouſneſs of Living, whereby Debauchery and ill Manners have much prevailed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, BY decrying the uſe of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in Matters of Religion.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, BY making Morality and Grace, oppoſite to one another.</p>
               <p>MEN of all Ages have been induſtrious to elude the practice of Moral Virtue by ſome trifling, childiſh, and unprofitable ſhews thereof: How can we, but ſtand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed at the folly of Mankind, that love to be their own Impoſtors,<note place="margin">Hypocriſie condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> and that when they may be truly good at ſo eaſie and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous a rate, labor to be but ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſo at the expence of a great deal of pain and trouble; and with the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> take twice as much pains to ſcour the
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:61474:183"/>
outſide of the Diſh, only that it may ſhine and gliſter, than is needful to keep the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide neat and cleanly: Thus they change wiſe Notices of things, for childiſh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits; freedom of Spirit for narrowneſs of Soul; chearfulneſs of Mind for ſlaviſh Fears; a ſweet and obliging Converſation for cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Zeal; Temperance and Sobriety, for harſh and Monkiſh Mortifications; in a word, they change all the Branches and Fruits of a holy Mind and virtuous Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for Forms and Gayeties: It will not therefore be unſeaſonable to caution Men againſt this Formality, as a moſt danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Cheat, that ſecretly enervates all the Power and Efficacy of that Goodneſs, it makes a ſhew of, that, whilſt it pretends highly to advance Religion, undermines it: This I ſhall endeavour to do,</p>
               <p>Firſt, BY laying down ſome of its moſt peculiar Characters.</p>
               <p>Secondly, BY diſcovering the Arts, it makes uſe of, to overthrow the power of Moral Virtue.</p>
               <p>Thirdly! BY explaining what the Power of Moral Virtue is, and wherein it conſiſts.</p>
               <p>FIRST then the Formaliſt ſerves God barely out of a Principle of <hi>Fear,</hi> and not at all out of <hi>Love;</hi> he only looks upon
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:61474:183"/>
Him, as a great and auſtere Being, that ſits in the Heavens, demanding harſh and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Homage from his Creatures; he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends Him, as an imperious <hi>Almighty One;</hi> that, becauſe He hath beſtowed upon us theſe little imperfect Beings, takes upon Him to impoſe ſevere and unreaſonable Laws, and exacts for the few pleaſures, He hath granted to the Life of Man, to be paid with ſharp and troubleſom Penances: But all this while he has not tho leaſt thought of gaining his Favor by divine and virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Qualities. Whereas if we would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the Spirit and Genius of true Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, we muſt look upon it as a wiſe and gracious Deſign of Heaven, to fill the Souls of Men, with all Excellencies perfective of their Natures;<note place="margin">Religion no Trick.</note> for Religion is no Trick or Artifice, but its natural deſign is to make Men <hi>truly good;</hi> it is no Contrivance of Heaven to bring advantages to it ſelf; but it was graciouſly intended for the ſake of Men, to carry on their Creator's Work, in compleating thoſe things, which He made, and to make 'em more like Him, than He left them: But the Formaliſt or Hypocrite, is utterly unacquainted with all inward Senſe of Goodneſs, and ſo he can pleaſe God, as he thinks, by giving him his due
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:61474:184"/>
of Religious Performances, he is not at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for ſolid and eſſential Righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>THUS the degenerate <hi>Jews</hi> in the time of the Prophets, were wont to be laviſh and profuſe in their Sacrifices, that they might be excuſed or wink'd at, for the Duties of <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Morality;</hi> they would offer the richeſt Oblations, a Thouſand Rams and Ten Thouſand Rivers of Oyl, all the Firſt-born of their Flocks and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, the Fruit of the Fields and their Bodies too, to purchaſe a diſpenſation for their Vices; they would not grudge to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie God, with any Sacrifice, rather than offer up their Luſts; they would honor Him, praiſe Him, flatter Him, give Him all his dues and more, ſpare neither for coſts nor charges in his Worſhip; and all this, only to bribe him, that He might indulge them their Self-wills and their Paſſions; and not be angry for their injuſtice, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, and unmercifulneſs; they were nice and punctual in their Faſts; would ſpare for no trouble to appear Devout; yet were there never any People in the World ſo vicious, as they; the Prophets every where upbraiding them with the moſt notorious Peeviſhneſs and Pride, Covetouſneſs and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition; for they were perſuaded, that ſuch
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:61474:184"/>
zealous Men, as they were, might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed for the ſake of their expenſive Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, all thoſe petty duties of Juſtice and Sobriety towards their Neighbors and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: On the contrary, a good Man Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips God, becauſe he loves Him, and loves him, becauſe he hates Vice; he loves the eternal Rules of Equity and right Reaſon, becauſe God loves 'em too.</p>
               <p>Secondly, THE Formaliſt is very buſie about the Means and Inſtruments of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but neglects the Ends thereof; he is very zealous in religious Performances, but ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly careleſs of all inward Virtue and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; hence it is, that the Minds of ſome Men are ſo little poſſeſſed with true and real Virtue, becauſe the Name of Religion hath been ſo much appropriated to its Forms; which Men are apt to be taken with, when they may be eaſily reconciled with their Vices and Paſſions: The <hi>Phariſees</hi> did juſt ſo; they only made great ſhews of Piety, to cover their Frauds and Rapines;<note place="margin">Too great a regard to Forms diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of real virtue.</note> they were curious to waſh their Hands, but took no care to purifie their Hearts; they would Faſt and ſtarve their Bodies, but at the ſame time, feed and pamper their Luſts; they would not Rob, but they did op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs their Neighbors; whilſt they relieved
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:61474:185"/>
their Brethren, they did at the ſame time hate and deſpiſe them: Thus the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Piety were made uſe of, as a means to ſubvert that, which they were ordained to advance; And thus it is in the relative and ſubordinate Duties of the Chriſtian Religion; if Men do as conſtantly commit, as they do confeſs their Sins, they fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate plainly the purpoſe of their Duty; and whilſt they are very Officious to run on God's Errand, they are very negligent of his Buſineſs: It is not every Confeſſion of our Sins, that He requires, but when it proceeds from an effectual Reſolution againſt them; and therefore where it ends not in Reformation, it ends in Hypocriſie; and to acknowledg, but not to Mortifie our Luſts, is only to tell God, we are great ſinners, and by his leave intend to continue ſo.</p>
               <p>IT is an eaſie matter for Men to preſent Heaven with large and perpetual addreſſes; but unleſs they be meek, merciful, humble, charitable, righteous, candid, and ingenuous, as well as Godly and Devout, they can in no wiſe <hi>enter into the kingdom of heaven:</hi> For the Chriſtian Religion dwells not amongſt its outſide Rites and Solemnities; but its proper Temple is, the Heart and Spirit of Man;
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:61474:185"/>
it reſides in the inmoſt receſſes of the Soul.</p>
               <p>NOW the Formaliſt is only for the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Acts, not for the internal Habits of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Goodneſs; his Actions, how good ſoever, iſſue only from fear, or cuſtom, or outward compliances, not from any good Temper or Modification of Mind; there appear no ſpots nor blemiſhes in his Face, his uncleanneſſes lodge within, and retire themſelves to the Centre of his Soul; thus his behaviour may be free from the common Pride and Vanity of the World, whilſt his mind is infected with the worſt Vices; the poſture of his Soul is as haughty and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percilious, as his demeanour is humble; his Thoughts as arrogant,<note place="margin">In what virtues our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our placed his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note> as his looks are lowly. But our Saviour ever told his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, that his Religion was to be placed in a a ſober and ſilent Piety, in Candour, Mildneſs and Humility, in doing good to all Men; that all the myſtery of it, lay in a good and virtuous Life; ſo that all the nice Notions and Hypotheſeſes concerning Faith, Juſtification, Election, and ſuch like Articles, are but fooliſh Traditions of ſome ſpeculative Heads; and thoſe that are moſt earneſt in theſe Controverſies, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly moſt negligent of moral Duty; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as true Religion is an active Principle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:61474:186"/>
that ſerves the Mind with all good and virtuous Qualities; it is, in a word, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſenſe and love of Goodneſs, that is the Fountain of all good Actions.</p>
               <p>A Mind temper'd with this Principle, ſuppreſſes all manner of untoward Paſſions; is governed by ſuch meekneſs, as abſolutely inclines it to pardon injuries, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in making good triumph over evil, and to ſatisfie it ſelf as much by forgiveneſs, as others are pleaſed with revenge: For where the inward temper of the Mind is truly humble, there a Man's inward eſteem of himſelf will be ſober and modeſt; his opinion of others candid and ingenuous: Wherefore if Men took as much care to fill their Souls with goodneſs, as well as their fancies with the notions of it, they would be as free from Paſſion, Self-will, and all other mental Vices, as from Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſs, Senſuality, and the other exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances of their bodily Appetites.</p>
               <p>Having thus ſet forth the Character of Formality, I now deſcend to the Second thing, to diſcover by what Way and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, it defeats the practice of moral Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; that perceiving its diſguiſes, we may not be impoſed upon: Now the Artifices, by which men are apt to delude themſelves, are mainly theſe,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="321" facs="tcp:61474:186"/>Firſt, THEY think, they may be diſpenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with in the Duties of <hi>practical Virtue</hi> for their extraordinary ſtrictneſs in ſome Duties of Godlineſs; they weigh their acts of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion againſt all their miſcarriages in <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality;</hi> if they do but <hi>Faſt twice a week,</hi> they preſently believe, that they may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to be froward and peeviſh: Hence it is, that the groſſeſt Vices are ſometimes called <hi>ſins of Infirmity;</hi> For when they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine themſelves in God's Favour for fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting the places of Worſhip, for hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sermons and Prayers; they are ready to conclude their moſt heinous ſins to be rather the weakneſſes of their Natures, than obliquities of their Wills, taking the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Virtue and Vice, not from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the actions themſelves, but from the conditions of the Perſons, that commit them; believing, that if a Man be once regenerat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, all his ſins are inſtantly changed into In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities: Thus the <hi>Stoicks</hi> of old made this one of their prime Paradoxes, that a wiſe Man of their Sect may be overcome with Wine, but can never be drunk; though to be overcome with Wine, be downright drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs in a carnal <hi>Epicurean;</hi> yet it was ſomething elſe in a <hi>great Stoick.</hi>

               <p>

and unaccountable motions as diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but enlighten our underſtandings; the Spirit of God only diſcovers the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, and enforces the Obligation of the Laws of God to the Conſciences of Men, and works in us a reaſonable love of our Duty, and ſerious reſolutions to diſcharge it: Therefore the Spirit of every good Man is ſober, diſcreet, and compoſed, ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the gravity and ſeriouſneſs of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; which floats not in his blood, nor riſes and <hi>falls with the</hi> Ebbs <hi>and Tides</hi> of his Humours; but he maintains a calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and evenneſs of Mind in all the various Conſtitutions of his Body; he confines his Piety entirely within his Soul; and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully keeps it from all mixtures of Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as knowing a Religious Fancy to be the greateſt Impoſtor in the World: And there is nothing, that ſpoils the Nature of the beſt Religion more, than outragious Zeal; which inſtead of ſweetning, embit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the minds of Men; ſo that thoſe Vices, which Moral Philoſophy would baniſh, are often kindled at the Altar of Religion; For it abuſes the prudence and diſcretion of good Men, abhors a Chriſt-like <hi>meekneſs</hi> and <hi>ſobriety,</hi> and fills their Religion with ill Nature and diſcontent: Hence it is, that
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:61474:188"/>
no Quarrels are ſo implacable as Religious ones; Men with great eagerneſs damn one another for Opinions and Speculative Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies.</p>
               <p>IF this be Religion; farewel all the Principles of Humanity and good Nature; farewel that Glory of the Chriſtian Faith, an univerſal Love and kindneſs for all Men; let us bid adieu to all the Practices of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and to the Innocence of a Chriſtian Spirit: Let the Laws of our Saviour be cancel'd, as Precepts of Sedition; Let us ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Religion out of Human Converſe, as the Mother of Rudeneſs and incivility; Let us go to the School of <hi>Atheiſm</hi> and <hi>Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> to learn good Manners.</p>
               <p>BUT if nothing bids greater defiance to the true Spirit and Genius of Religion, than a <hi>Form of Godlineſs, denying the Power thereof;</hi> then let not the Wiſdom of God be charged with the Folly of Men: Let then the furious Sons of Zeal, without the Power of Godlineſs, tell me the meaning of ſuch Texts, as theſe; <hi>Learn of me, for I am meek and humble; I beſeech you, that you walk worthy of the vocation, wherewith you are called with all lowlineſs, long-ſuffering, forbearing one another in Love; put on there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved,

               <p>WHAT remains then, but that we ſet our ſelves to a ſerious minding of true and real Goodneſs;<note place="margin">An exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to mind true and real Goodneſs.</note> that we trifle not away our Time in purſuing the Shadows of it, nor waſte our Zeal upon its Forms and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; that we cheat not our Souls with a partial Godlineſs, nor damn them with an half-Religion: For we muſt meaſure our profitableneſs under the means of Grace, by the influences of it upon the obedience of our Lives; we muſt purſue Chriſtianity in its true and proper uſefulneſs; give a ſincere Obedience to every Law of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs; we muſt not divorce Piety from Juſtice and Charity, but join the love of God with the love of our Brother; be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient againſt our own Sins, and other

               <p>IN the ſecond place we muſt obſerve, That licentiouſneſs of Living hath brought a great decay upon <hi>Moral Virtue;</hi> The Chriſtian Religion, rightly underſtood, and ſincerely practiſed, ſerves no doubt to make

<pb n="329" facs="tcp:61474:190"/>
Covetouſneſs, Ambition, Malice, and all that's Evil: It is true, in the ancient Authors, which ſtudious Men turn over, they find deſcriptions of <hi>Virtues</hi> more perfect, than really they were; the Governments are repreſented better, and the ways of Life pleaſanter, than they deſerved; upon this theſe bookiſh Men compare what they read with what they ſee, and here beholding nothing ſo Heroically tranſcendent, becauſe they are able to mark all the ſpots, as well as beauties of every thing, that is ſo cloſe to their ſight, they preſently begin to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe their own times, and exalt the paſt, to contemn the Virtues, and aggravate the Vices of their Age: But ſuch is the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Religion,<note place="margin">Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery a great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment to the growth of Religion.</note> that the Moral part of it ſuffers much by reaſon of the Debauchery and ill Manners of Men: And when lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs hath gotten a habit, and Men's Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads are Brazen in their wickedneſs, they will not receive a check from diſarmed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; but rather harden themſelves againſt it, and account that their Enemy, which they are ſure will not give countenance to the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they are now ſettled in: Beſides when a Licentious courſe of Life hath brought Men to diſuſe the Duties and Offices of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, all its Obligations are antiquated with
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:61474:191"/>
them; then inſtead of Prayers they learn to Curſe and Swear, and from not going to Church for a time, grow to plead a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg not to come at it at all.</p>
               <p>Secondly, NOT only looſneſs of Life, but alſo a wrong apprehenſion of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Liberty, hath much obſtructed the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of moral Virtue; for ſome Men have thought themſelves diſcharged thereby from all the obligations of the Moral Law, and have been ſo abſurd as to take the Goſpel to contain nothing elſe properly, but a Publication of God's Promiſes, and that thoſe Promiſes are abſolute, without any Condition of our Obedience, ſo that neither men's Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on nor Salvation do depend upon it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiniſm a pernicious Principle.</note>THIS is the Doctrine of modern Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and is a Perſwaſion fit to Debauch the whole World; about the Apoſtles times, it was much pleaded for by the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> to excuſe their revolts from Chriſtianity in Times of Perſecution, and their beaſtly Senſualities; as if the knowledg of the Truth gave a Priviledg, neither to profeſs nor practiſe it; when the one proved too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodious to their ſecular Intereſts, or the other too diſguſtful to their ſenſual Inclinations.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="331" facs="tcp:61474:191"/>WHEREAS the contents of the great Character purchaſed for us,<note place="margin">What the Liberty is, which Chriſt hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed for us.</note> and brought in by the Lord Jeſus, are theſe; that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the freeing us from the Dominion of Sin, which the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> could not do, and the Tyranny of Satan, which the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile <hi>World lay under,</hi> He hath ſet our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences at liberty from Judaick Rites, to purſue our own Reaſon, and to ſerve all the intereſts of Peace and good Order in the World; hence it is, that we find li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and condeſcenſion or ſelf-denyal joined together by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 5.13. <hi>ye have been called unto liberty, only uſe not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, as an occaſion to the fleſh, but by love ſerve one another,</hi> and by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1. Eph. 2.16. <hi>as free, yet not uſing your liberty, as a Cloak of maliciouſneſs, but as the ſervants of God:</hi> But if Religion ſhould ſet us free from the Rules of Virtue, all the duties of it would be uncertain and precarious things; nay it would deſtroy it ſelf, and the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties of Men would be ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the better for it, that their happineſs would be undermined thereby; but this is ſo expreſsly contrary to the whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the Chriſtian Doctrine, and goes ſo croſs to the very Senſe of every honeſt Mind, that I ſhall not ſpend any more words about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="332" facs="tcp:61474:192"/>IN the Third place we are to conſider, how the progreſs of Moral Virtue hath been diſcouraged by <hi>decrying the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> in Matters of Religion; as if Reaſon was not as much the Word of God, as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation; as if whatever contradicts Reaſon, was not oppoſite to Faith: For <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Reaſon was a great confirmation of his Faith two Revelations were made to him,<note place="margin">Our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms our Faith.</note> that ſeeemed to claſh one with another, and if his Reaſon could not have reconciled their difference, he could not have believed them both to have been from God; for Divine Revelation doth not give new Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties to Men, but propounds new Objects to thoſe Faculties; ſo that when God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals any thing to us, He reveals it to our Underſtandings, that we may judg concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; that we may not believe every Spirit, but try whether they be from Him or no; now that which hath ſpoiled the Lives of many Men, is there aſſenting to ſuch Doctrins, as never came from the Fountain of Truth; therefore to preſerve our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity and keep the Truth, we muſt try the Spirits and compare the evidences Men bring for what they aſſert, which it is not poſſible to do, but by the Uſe of our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: But to be confident and peremptory
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:61474:192"/>
in any thing without Reaſon, is nothing, but obſtinacy of Mind.</p>
               <p>WHEREAS if we turn off Reaſon, we level the beſt and moſt deſirable Doctrine in the World, with the vaineſt Enthuſiaſm; now by the Principles of Reaſon, we are not to underſtand the Grounds of any Man's Philoſophy, nor the <hi>critical Rules of Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſm;</hi> but thoſe fundamental Notices, that God hath planted in our Souls; whereby we know, that every thing is made for an End, and every thing is directed to its End by certain Rules; theſe Rules in Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Underſtanding and Choice, are Laws; and in Tranſgreſſing theſe, is Vice and Sin.</p>
               <p>AS for Arguments from Scripture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Uſe of Reaſon, 'tis alledged, that <hi>God will deſtroy the wiſdom of the wiſe</hi> and <hi>that the world by wiſdom knew not God:</hi> But by this <hi>wiſdom</hi> is not meant the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Mankind, but the Traditions of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the Philoſophy of the Diſputing <hi>Greeks,</hi> and the Policy of the <hi>Romans;</hi> all which the Apoſtle ſets at naught, becauſe they were very contrary to the Simplicity and Holineſs, to the Self-denyal and Meekneſs of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="334" facs="tcp:61474:193"/>Secondly, IT is ſaid, that the natural Man receiveth not the Things of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, for they are Fooliſhneſs to him; neither can he know them, becauſe they are Spiritually diſcerned; by which Words nothing more is intended; than that a Man, who is guided purely by natural Reaſon and is not enlightned by Divine Revelation, cannot underſtand matters of pure Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but he thinks them abſurd and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, till they are made known to him by the Revelation of the Spirit of God; and when they are ſo, nothing appears in the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of Religion, but what is agreeable to the ſoundeſt Reaſon and Wiſdom.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, IT is urged, that our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is very liable to be miſled by our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Affections, by our Intereſts and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aginations, ſo that many times we mingle Errours and falſe Conceits with the genuine Dictates of our Minds, and appeal to them, as the Principles of Truth, when they are the falſe Concluſions of Ignorance and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake: All that can be infer'd from hence is, that we ought not to be too bold in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining Speculative and difficult Matters, nor ſet our Reaſonings againſt the Doctrines of Faith: But this doth not tend to the Diſreputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Reaſon in the Object, that is, thoſe
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:61474:193"/>
Principles of Truth, which are Written upon our Souls; for if we may not uſe our Underſtandings, Scripture it ſelf will <hi>ſignifie either nothing at all, or very little to us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THEREFORE to decry the Uſe of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, is to introduce Atheiſm;<note place="margin">The miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs of decrying the uſe of Reaſon.</note> for what greater advantage can the Atheiſt have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Virtue, than that Reaſon is againſt the Precepts of it: This will make our Religion depend upon a warm Fancy, and an ungrounded Belief, ſo that it can ſtand only, till a new Conceit alter the Scene of Imagination.</p>
               <p>Secondly, TO decry the Uſe of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, is to lay our ſelves open to infinite Follies and Impoſtures; when every thing that is reaſonable, is called vain Philoſopy; and every thing, that is ſober, carnal Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning: This is the way to make up a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion without Senſe, and without Moral Virtue; This is to put out our Eyes, that we may ſee, and to hoodwink our ſelves, that we may avoid the precipices of Vice: Thus have all extravagancies been brought into Religion beyond the imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations of a Feaver, and the conceits of Midnight.</p>
               <p>THE laſt and greateſt obſtacle to the Progreſs of moral Virtue is ſome Men's mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:61474:194"/>
Morality and Grace oppoſite to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:<note place="margin">Grace and Morality are not oppoſites.</note> To divorce Grace from Virtue, and to diſtinguiſh the ſpiritual Chriſtian from the Moral Man, is a modern invention; for not one ancient Author, that hath treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of our Religion, did ever make any difference between the Nature of Moral Virtue and Evangelical Grace; Evangelical Grace being nothing elſe in their account, but Moral Virtue heightned by the Motives of the Goſpel and the aſſiſtances of the Spirit; both which are external Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the Eſſence of the thing it ſelf; ſo that the Chriſtian Inſtitution does not introduce any new Duties diſtinct from the Eternal Rules of <hi>Morality,</hi> but ſtrengthens them by new Obligations, and improves them by new Principles: For,</p>
               <p>THE Power to perform theſe Duties comes from the internal Operations of the holy Spirit, which applies the Motives of Religion to our Minds, and by them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades us to every good Action; that we are enlightned with the knowledg of Chriſt, cometh of his Gift, who diſpoſeth us to learn the <hi>Truth;</hi> that we attend to the Word of God and are wrought into a ſerious Temper; that we are excited to good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:61474:194"/>
and confirmed in them, cometh of his Grace, who putteth good thoughts into our minds, thereby moveth our Wills and Affections moſt powerfully to every good Work, or to every Moral Vertue, which conſiſts not only in the decency of outward behaviour, but is a prevailing inclination of the mind to thoſe Manners, or that way of Life, which is beſt for a reaſonable Creature; or it is an univerſal goodneſs of Manners in Mind and in Practice.</p>
               <p>NOW it is named <hi>Virtue,</hi> becauſe the ſtrength and vigour of a reaſonable creature, conſiſteth in a temper of Mind, and courſe of Life agreeable to right Reaſon; it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Moral,</hi> becauſe it is converſant about the cuſtomary diſpoſitions and actions of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Creatures: ſo thoſe Laws, that are given with rational inducements to Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, are ſaid to be <hi>Moral Laws,</hi> as being proper and ſuitable to the nature of rational Beings, to whom they are preſcribed; and this in oppoſition to the Laws of Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Matter, by which God governs the reſt of his Works: for that Agent which hath no power over it ſelf, but acts, becauſe it muſt; whatſoever laudable effects it may produce; it is as uncapable of Morality, as thoſe ſenſeleſs Machines are,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:61474:195"/>
that move by the Laws of Matter and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>NOW the duties required of us in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace are <hi>Moral</hi> in the ſtricteſt Senſe; ſo that Holineſs and Moral Vertue are in truth the ſame things diverſly expreſſed; for to <hi>do</hi> that, <hi>which is</hi> good, and to <hi>do it</hi> well is the ſum of both: and it is plain that thoſe perfections in God, which our Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is an imitation of, are Juſtice, Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and Truth, his Patience, Mercy, and Charity; his hatred of Sin, and his love of Righteouſneſs; all which are Moral Perfections; and therefore when in theſe things we are followers of God our imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of him does neceſſarily become <hi>Moral Vertue:</hi> and thoſe Duties, which work in us the neareſt likeneſs to Chriſt Jeſus, are Meekneſs, Humility, Patience, Self-denial, contempt of the World, readineſs to paſs by Wrongs, to forgive Enemies, to love and do good to all, are all in the moſt proper ſenſe Moral Vertues: indeed to <hi>glorifie God in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> is an end of Obedience, which <hi>Nature</hi> teacheth not; but being made known by <hi>Grace,</hi> we are obliged to regard this end by the Rules of Morality; which are derived from Chriſt, and cauſed by the Spirit; ſo that we have no reaſon to
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:61474:195"/>
boaſt of their being ſo much in our own power.</p>
               <p>WHEREFORE let not Men think they can be Holy without Moral Vertue; which they will be apt to do, whenever Grace is ſet in Oppoſition to Virtue; they may as well think they may be godly without Religion; Devout and Pious, without all ſober and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere uſe of their Underſtandings in ſpiritual matters, for this miſchief will certainly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue upon it, that Men will embrace Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors and Allegories, fancies and forms of Speech, inſtead of the Subſtance of true and real Righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>'TIS certain then,<note place="margin">The Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Morality are the moſt weighty concerns of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> that the Duties of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality are the moſt weighty and material Concerns of Religion: and as in the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Generation of Mankind that vital prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple the Soul, forms and moulds the <hi>foetus</hi> according to the ſpecifical Nature of Man, and never gives over, till it has worked the whole bodily Maſs into a full Complement of parts; ſo by a new Principle of Life, called <hi>Grace,</hi> and derived from God through Chriſt into the mind, true Wiſdom, Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, Juſtice, Holineſs, Integrity, and all the inſtances of Moral Vertue, are fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioned by this quickning ſpirit, in the thoughts and actions of good and pious

Men: This makes the whole myſtery of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation intelligible, ſo that any <hi>Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> may diſcern the manner and reaſon of it; for to be born again, ſignifies in its utmoſt meaning, to become a ſincere Diſciple of our Lord Jeſus, and to be his Diſciple, is to believe and obey, as we are ingaged by Baptiſm; this being the cleareſt proof we can give to our ſelves or others, that we own him in good earneſt to be our Lord and Maſter, if for his ſake we love Truth and Goodneſs, above all worldly intereſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">What is meant by the New Creature.</note>NOW to be <hi>Regenerate</hi> is to be the <hi>ſincere</hi> Diſciples of Chriſt, which will qualifie a Man for the Kingdom of Heaven; and if that be true, it follows, that Regeneration and all thoſe other Metaphors, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the ſtate of a Man fitted for eternal Happineſs, do mean nothing elſe; but his being ſuch a Diſciple of Chriſt, as to believe in him, to love, and obey him; when the word of God, that Divine Seed, hath wrought its due and proper effects upon his Soul by its Precepts, the temper of his Mind, and the diſpoſition of his Will are agreeable to the Laws of God: therefore we uſe to ſay of a meek ſpirited Man, that he cannot be furious; and of an honeſt Man, that he cannot deceive; and of a generous

               <p>THUS Grace and Vertue go hand in hand together; one being a certain Product of the other; Evangelical Graces being the ſame thing for ſubſtance with Evangelical Vertues, and theſe the ſame with Moral ones: hence it is, that the Word of God doth more effectually oblige and enable Mankind to an Holy Life, than any other Inſtitution could effect, or Philoſophy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend; for Religion is the ſame now as it was in the ſtate of Innocence; for as then the whole Duty of Man conſiſted in the Practice of all thoſe Moral Vertues, that aroſe from his Natural Relation to God and Man; ſo all, that is ſuperinduced upon us ſince the

               <p>THE proper Inference therefore from the whole is, that we reſolve to go on in a good Courſe of Life, becauſe by this means our Work will be eaſier to us, if we be diligent in governing our Converſation by the Rules of Vertue: the difficulty of Religion will ſtill grow leſs, becauſe our ſtrength will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, and God hath promiſed to give greater degrees of aſſiſtance to them that uſe what he hath already beſtowed, then our endeavours muſt concur with this aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which God gives; for the Spirit doth uſually work inſenſibly upon the minds of Men, and therefore it is compared to the Wind, which no Man ſees, whence it cometh, nor whether it goeth: even ſo is the Spirit of God, Men feel motions upon their Hearts, but how theſe are produced, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together

               <p>Thirdly, BY the common conſent of Mankind.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, BY External Revelation.</p>
               <p>FIRST there is a ſecret impreſſion upon the Minds of Men, whereby they are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally directed to approve ſome things as
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:61474:202"/>
                  <hi>good,</hi> and avoid other things as <hi>evil;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Natural Inſtinct teaches us what is Good and what is Evil.</note> juſt as the Creatures below Men are by a natural Inſtinct led to their own preſervation, and to take care of their young ones. In like manner we find in human Nature a propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to ſome things that are beneficial, and a loathing of other things, that are hurtful to them; the former appear beautiful and lovely, the latter ugly and deformed.</p>
               <p>NOW theſe inclinations do not proceed from Reaſon, but from Nature, and are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent to all Diſcourſe, as it is manifeſt from hence, that they are as ſtrong, and do put forth themſelves as vigorouſly in young per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as in thoſe that are older; they do ſhew themſelves as much in the rude and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant ſort of People, as in thoſe who are more refined, and better inſtructed, which is a plain Argument that they come from <hi>Nature,</hi> and not from <hi>Reaſon;</hi> for if they proceeded from Reaſon, they would appear moſt eminently in thoſe perſons, who are of the beſt and moſt improved Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and would be very obſcure in ſuch as exerciſe their Reaſon but a little: whereas experience ſhews us, that the moſt igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant ſort of Mankind have as lively a ſenſe of Piety and Devotion, as great a regard to all kinds of Sobriety, as tender Affections to

their Children, as much honor for their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, as true a ſenſe of Gratitude and Juſtice, as the wiſeſt and moſt knowing part of Mankind.</p>
               <p>AND theſe are the Duties that are of greateſt importance to us; ſo that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God appears herein to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully careful of the happineſs and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of Mankind, in that he hath wrought ſuch inclinations into our Natures, as to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the moſt material parts of our Duty, in planting in us a natural ſenſe of <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil;</hi> ſo that in many caſes if we do but conſult our own Natures, we need no other Oracle to tell us, what we ought to do, and what to avoid; how we ought to reverence the Divine Nature, honor our Parents, love our Children, be grateful to our Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours, and thoſe that have obliged us, to ſpeak the Truth, to be faithful to our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, to reſtore the thing that was intruſted with us, to pity thoſe that are in Miſery, and to deal equally with other Men, as we would that they ſhould deal with us. There is no need of any ſubtle reaſoning to prove the fitneſs or unfitneſs of theſe things, becauſe it is prevented by the very Inſtinct of Nature, which teaches us what we ought to do in theſe caſes.</p>

               <p>BUT yet there is a conſiderable difficulty in this matter; becauſe the Opinions of Men have been much divided about Virtue and Vice; the different Laws and Cuſtoms of ſeveral Nations ſeem to argue, that they are not ſo well agreed about theſe things; conſequently the difference between Good and Evil is not ſo well known: more than this, there is in Mankind a propenſion to evil, and Men are generally vicious; which ſeems to contradict that natural Inſtinct, which ſhews us, as we ſay, what is Virtue, and what is Vice.</p>

he is as rarely to be met with as Monſters, and no more to be drawn into an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt the truth of this Aſſertion, than a Man being born with three Legs can be an Argument, that Men naturally have not two.

               <p>FOR by natural Inſtinct we know what we ought to do, antecedent to all Reaſon and Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Natural Reaſon tells us what is our Duty.</note> OUR Duty is alſo diſcovered to us by natural Reaſon; for the force of moral Actions are planted in Mens Minds, and woven into the frame of their Natures: but to make our Duty more plain, God by the light of Reaſon hath ſhewed us what <hi>is good,</hi> and what <hi>is evil;</hi> and not only ſo, but he ſtamps upon them the <hi>Authority</hi> of <hi>Laws;</hi> for theſe two are very different, to apprehend <hi>a thing good for us to do,</hi> and to be under the <hi>Obligation of a Law to do it;</hi> for to this it is neceſſary, we ſhould appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:61474:206"/>
it to be the Will of our Superior, that we ſhould perform it.</p>
               <p>NOW our Reaſon doth diſcover to us, what is Virtue, and that the Lord our God doth require our Obedience to it;</p>
               <p>Firſt, BY ſhewing us how convenient and agreeable it is to our Natures.</p>
               <p>Secondly, BY the tendency of it, to make us happy, and to free us from Evil and Miſery.</p>
               <p>NOTHING is more ſuitable to our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, than to have an eſteem of what is great and excellent; and Mankind being taught, that all Perfection is in God, we muſt adore him; for that which is good, doth naturally beget Love and Reverence; ſo it is agreeable to our Natures, to honor our Parents, to be grateful for Benefits re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, to be juſt and righteous, to be cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable, compaſſionate, and temperate; to be meek, humble, and prudent: Thoſe that act contrary to theſe Duties, offer an Affront to their own Natures, and feel a pain in themſelves, however they may carry it to others.</p>
               <p>BESIDES, theſe things tend to make us happy, and to free us from Miſery; for Reaſon conſiders the conſequences of things; and we call that Virtue or Good, which will
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:61474:206"/>
bring ſome benefit to us, and that Evil or Vice, which is like to bring upon us ſome Inconvenience; upon this account Reaſon doth ſhew us what is good, and what is evil; to begin with Piety <hi>towards God;</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more reaſonable, than to make him our Friend, who is able to make us happy or miſerable; and the way to make him our Friend, is to obſerve all the Vertues of a good life; on the contrary, Impiety or a neglect of Vertue is plainly againſt our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt; for this is to diſoblige him, who is more able to make us miſerable than all the World beſides, and without whoſe Favour nothing can make us happy: ſo that our Reaſon will require us to live vertuouſly; as for inſtance, If Nature did not teach us Gratitude, Diſcretion would, it being the only way to obtain a ſecond Favour, to be thankful for the firſt: Humility may ſeem to be a thing of no great Advantage, but he that ſhall conſider what contempt Pride expoſeth a Man unto, will be of another mind; Temperance tends to our Happineſs in this, that it tends to our Health, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, all the Enjoyments of this Life are but little worth: on the other ſide, the intemperate Man is an Enemy to himſelf, continually making Aſſaults upon his own
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:61474:207"/>
Life; the Apoſtle adviſeth, that we ſhould abſtain from fleſhly Luſts, that war againſt the Soul, and it ought to be no ſmall Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to us, that they war againſt the Body alſo; ſo for Kindneſs and Love, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that they are good to others, they are of much uſe and benefit to our ſelves; for there is unſpeakable pleaſure in Love, a great deal of eaſe in a charitable Temper: on the contrary, how fretting and vexatious to the Mind of Man are Malice, Envy, and Hatred; they do not only raiſe Enemies abroad, but they ſet a Man againſt himſelf, and deprive him of the Peace of his own Mind:<note place="margin">Compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Mercy is profitable to others and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful to our ſelves.</note> ſo Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion and Mercy are not more profitable unto other Men than they are delightful to our own Souls; and we do not only grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our ſelves by doing Services to others, but we thereby provoke Mankind by our Example to the like Kindneſſes, and ſo turn the pity of others to our ſelves, when it ſhall come to be our turn to ſtand in need of their help. In like manner, our Reaſon directs us to the practice of Truth, Fidelity, and Juſtice, as the ſureſt Arts of thriving in this World; theſe beget Confidence, and give Men a Reputation in their Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood: and theſe Vertues, our Reaſon tells us, have the force of a Law; and there needs
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:61474:207"/>
nothing to <hi>give the force of a Law</hi> to any matter, but the ſtamp of divine Authority upon it. Now God, that made us and all other Creatures, and by virtue of his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over us hath imprinted on our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures the Principles of Good and Evil; and hath ſo wrought 'em into the frame of our Souls, by which, as by a natural inſtinct, Men are carried to approve what is good, and diſapprove what is evil; and ſuppoſing that our natural Reaſons do tell us, that it is for our Intereſt to live in the practice of what we call Vertue, and to diſlike and avoid what we call Vice; this is a ſufficient de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, that we ſhould do the one and avoid the other; and if we live contrary to this, we violate <hi>the Law</hi> of him that made us; for there needs nothing to make a thing become <hi>a Law</hi> to us, but that it is the Will of our Sovereign, who hath Right to require it of us: And this God hath declared to Mankind by the frame of their <hi>Natures,</hi> and by thoſe principal Faculties he hath endued us withal; for no Man can imagine but that we ſhould follow the Inſtruction of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and be governed by the natural Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our own Minds. And thoſe natural Paſſions of Hope and Fear,<note place="margin">Hope and Fear are two very ſtrong Paſſions.</note> that are ſo root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our Souls, we cannot, without great
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:61474:208"/>
force to our ſelves, act contrary to them. And this is all the <hi>Law</hi> that great part of Mankind comes under, and which is no other than that which the Apoſtle calls the Work of the Law written upon their Hearts; and they having no other Revelation made to them, ſhall be judged by it; and thoſe that offend againſt this Law ſhall be found guilty before God, as well as thoſe that have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt an expreſs Revelation; which is a plain Evidence, that theſe natural Dictates have the force of a Law, otherwiſe Men would not be guilty of any Crime by act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt them; for it is a Rule univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally true, that where there is no <hi>Law</hi> there is no <hi>Tranſgreſſion;</hi> and this I take to be the meaning of that obſcure Paſſage of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> v. 13. for <hi>until the Law, Sin was in the World,</hi> that is, before the Law was given unto <hi>Moſes</hi> Men were capable of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and therefore there was <hi>another Law,</hi> againſt which they offended; for Sin is not imputed where there is no Law: But Death reigned from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moſes</hi> even over them that had not ſinned after the ſimilitude of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Tranſgreſſion; that is, tho they did not ſin againſt any expreſs Law of God, as <hi>Adam</hi> did. Thus Reaſon diſcovers to us, how that the natural Dictates of our Minds have the force of a Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="365" facs="tcp:61474:208"/>HENCE we may infer, that Mankind would have been under the Obligation of Religion, tho God had never made any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Revelation of his Mind and Will unto them: if this was not ſo, the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, who had no ſupernatural Revelation from God, could not have been guilty of Sin, nor liable to his Judgment; for if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>were Vertue</hi> or <hi>Vice,</hi> but what was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expreſly commanded or forbidden by God, then <hi>all Actions</hi> would have been alike to the Heathen: But there are ſome things <hi>naturally</hi> good, and ſome things <hi>naturally</hi> evil, and Men are bound to do the one and fly the other, tho God had never made any ſupernatural Revelation of his Will to them. For if God had never forbidden Hatred and Malice, with Deceit, Oppreſſion, Violence, and the like Paſſions; they would have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared evil in themſelves, and ought not to have been done by us; becauſe they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the Peace of Human Society, and contrary to the Nature and Reaſon of Mankind; ſo on the other hand the Vertues oppoſite to theſe, as Love to God, together with Truth and Juſtice one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, have ſuch Goodneſs in them, that they are commended to the liking of Mankind without the need of any abſolute Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:61474:209"/>
to oblige Men to the practice of them. If theſe things were not ſo, the Tables might have been turned, and all that which we now call Vertue, might have been forbidden by God, and things would have been every whit as well; and there would have been no difference, only the Names of things would have been changed.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Good and Evil is unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note>BUT I appeal to any ones Reaſon, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he can think it as vertuous an Action to hate God, as to love him; to contemn, as to honor him; and whether Malice, Envy, Hatred, and Ingratitude, would have made as much for the Peace of Mankind, as the practice of Love and Goodneſs would have done; if they would not, then it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that there is ſomething in the Nature of Things, that made the difference: and ſo long as the Nature of God and Man remain what they are, ſome Things will be in their own Natures unalterably good, and ſome things evil; which doth not depend upon any ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Conſtitution, but is founded in the Nature of the Things themſelves.<note place="margin">The ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of mankind ſhews what is Virtue and what is Vice</note>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, WHAT is Virtue, and what is Vice, is ſhewn to us by the general vote and conſent of Mankind; which we do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to all the inſtances of Virtue and Vice, but only to the great and more eſſential parts
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:61474:209"/>
of it; ſuch as Piety to God, Adoration of the Divine Nature, Gratitude to Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors, Temperance, Meekneſs, Charity, Juſtice, Fidelity, and ſuch like: theſe are agreed upon by mankind to be good, and the contrary to theſe evil; for they are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally had in eſteem by Men, and their oppoſites are evil ſpoken off; now to <hi>praiſe</hi> any thing is to give teſtimony to the goodneſs of it, and to <hi>diſpraiſe</hi> any thing, is to declare it to be evil: and if we conſider the Cuſtoms of the World, and the inſtances of all Ages, we ſhall find that the Things that have been praiſed in the lives of Men, are the Piety and Devotion of Men towards their Gods, their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance and Gratitude, their Juſtice and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, their Humanity and Charity. The contraries to theſe have been ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, as Atheiſm and Profaneneſs, contempt of God and Religion, Ingratitude, Falſneſs, Oppreſſion, Cruelty. Nay, ſo ſteddy hath mankind been in commending Virtue, and cenſuring Vice,<note place="margin">Vicious Men ſpeak well of Virtue.</note> that we ſhall find not only the virtuous themſelves giving their teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to Virtue, but even thoſe that <hi>are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,</hi> have ſo much Juſtice as to ſpeak well of Moral Virtues, not out of love to them, but becauſe their Affections are prevented
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:61474:210"/>
by the Conviction of their own Minds, and the teſtimony of theſe perſons is the more valuable, becauſe it is that of an Enemy: for Friends are apt to be partial, but the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of an Enemy is of great weight, becauſe it ſeems to be extorted from him and that which he is even forced to do againſt his will. And it is a clear evidence that Vice is generally cryed down by Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, becauſe thoſe that are ſo kind as to ſpare themſelves, are yet very quick-ſighted to ſpy a fault in any one elſe, and will ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Vice in another with very much free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>HENCE it is, that the Scripture com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, that our Light ſhould ſo ſhine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Men, that they may ſee our good works <hi>Matth.</hi> v. 13. Charges us to promiſe things honeſt in the ſight of all Men, <hi>Rom.</hi> xii. 17. To have our Converſation honeſt among the Gentiles, that is, to do thoſe things which the Light of Nature cannot but approve of, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> ii. 12. By well doing to put to ſilence the ignorance of fooliſh Men: for this, ſaith the Apoſtle, is the Will of God; by which it is intimated, that there are ſome Virtues ſo good in themſelves, and ſo owned to be ſuch, that the worſt of Men have not the face to open their mouths a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="369" facs="tcp:61474:210"/>BESIDES Mankind do generally ſtand upon their Juſtification when they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious to themſelves, that they have done well, but are aſhamed, when they have done ill: Some indeed are ſuch Monſters of Impiety, that they can glory in their Shame; but theſe are but few in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and they attain to this Temper by a long habit of great and enormous Vices: But generally Men are Modeſt and are apt to Bluſh at what they do amiſs: Now Shame is a Trouble ariſing from a Senſe,<note place="margin">What Shame is.</note> that we have done amiſs, and have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited our Reputation; <hi>Guilt</hi> is a <hi>Paſſion</hi> towards our ſelves, but <hi>Shame</hi> is with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to others; ſo that he, who is aſhamed of an Action, doth thereby declare, that he hath acted amiſs, and that, what he hath done, is accounted ſo by others; for if he did not believe, that Men had a bad opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſuch actions; however he might be <hi>guilty</hi> in himſelf, he would not be aſhamed in reſpect of other Men: But when Men have walked by the Rules of Virtue, the Conſcience of their Integrity lifts up their Heads, becauſe they are ſatisfied, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Men have a good eſteem of their Actions: And the Men ſometimes will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their diſlike of the Ways of Virtue,
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:61474:211"/>
yet they have a ſecret reverence for thoſe, that do well, and when their Paſſions are over, they cannot but declare their Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation and frequently do ſo:<note place="margin">All Men have a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence for thoſe that do well.</note> And this is a great evidence of the Conſent of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind about Virtue and Vice; for that thoſe, that do their Duty, act above Board, and live in the Practice of Goodneſs, need not hide their Faces, nor ſeek dark corners to do their work in, as they, who are forg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evil deeds, muſt do: For no Man is aſhamed to meet another, with whom he has kept his Word and performed his Truſt, as he, who hath done otherwiſe, is wont to be; Glory and Shame, being an appeal to the Judgment of Mankind, concerning the <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Evil</hi> of our Actions.</p>
               <p>NOW Vices, ſuch as Murder, Adultery, Drunkenneſs, Rebellion, Sedition, Fraud, Perjury, and breach of Truſt, are provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt by moſt Nations, and ſeverely puniſhed by the Laws of moſt Countrys, which is a demonſtration, what opinion all Nations have had of theſe things;<note place="margin">No Law ever made againſt Virtue.</note> but there was never any Law made againſt Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; no Man was ever forbidden to honour God; tho particular Ways of Worſhip have been prohibited; no Man was ever forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to be grateful, faithful, temperate,
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:61474:211"/>
juſt, righteous, honeſt, charitable, and peaceable; which is an acknowledgment, that Mankind always thought 'em good, and were never ſenſible of any harm or miſchief to come by them; for had they done ſo, they would at ſome time or other provided againſt 'em by Laws; but as the Apoſtle ſaith, againſt theſe things there is no Law; as if he had ſaid; turn over the Laws of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſearch thoſe of <hi>Athens,</hi> read over the Twelve Tables of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and you ſhall not find one of thoſe Virtues that are commanded in the Scripture, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned or forbidden; a ſure and clear proof, that Mankind never took any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception againſt them, but reſted in the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of them; that they were neceſſary and profitable for all things.</p>
               <p>NOW this general conſent of Mankind about what is Good and Evil, is a very good Argument of their being ſo in Truth and reality; for the Conſent of Mankind is the Voice of Nature, and the Voice of Nature is the Voice of God, the Author thereof; for <hi>Tully tells us,</hi> that God would not have planted theſe Notions in the Minds of Men, had they not been agreeable to the Truth of Things; there is no better way to eſtabliſh, what is Natural, than if
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:61474:212"/>
the whole <hi>kind agree</hi> in it, and if it be Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, it is from God, and whatever is from God, is Real and True: Now I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that God hath planted in Humane Nature, a Senſe of the difference between Virtue and Vice, and hath made us able to judg, what is Good, and what is Evil.</p>
               <p>BUT beſides this, there are but two Cauſes, into which this general Conſent of Mankind can be reſolved, <hi>Tradition</hi> and <hi>humane Policy;</hi> not Tradition, becauſe that is inſufficient for ſo large and long a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of ſo many particulars, as the Law of Nature conſiſts in, throughout all Ages and Nations; for the Traditions of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Nations, which are ſuppoſed to be Arbitrary, and to have no foundation in Reaſon and Nature; theſe do depend wholly upon inſtruction and memory, and cannot be preſerved without them; but we ſee among the Rude and Ignorant, upon whom hardly any care or inſtruction is uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, men have as lively a ſenſe of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between virtue and vice, in many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, as the more learned part of the World; which is a plain Argument, that theſe things are not conveyed to us by Tradition: Nor can they be applyed to <hi>humane Policy;</hi> for many of theſe things were never enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:61474:212"/>
by humane Laws, and yet they obtain among Mankind, as Gratitude, Charity, and ſuch like; <hi>Seneca</hi> ſays, that Gratitude was never enjoyned by any Law, but that of the <hi>Macedonians;</hi> which plainly ſhews, that theſe things owe their <hi>Original</hi> to ſome other Cauſe, and that they are to be attributed to Nature, the Author of which is God; and the general Conſent of Mankind is an argument of their Truth and Reality.</p>
               <p>HOWEVER, it is Objected, that ſeveral Perſons, and ſome whole Nations have dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered about ſome of theſe things, ſo that this Conſent is not ſo general; beſides the Conſent of the World in Superſtition and Idolatry, may ſeem to weaken this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the univerſal Agreement of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind about <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WE Anſwer, that it is not denied, but that Men may ſo vitiate their Natures,<note place="margin">Nature may be ſo vitiated as to loſe the Senſe of Virtue and Vice.</note> as to loſe the ſenſe of Virtue and Vice; yet it may remain true, that Mankind have a natural Senſe and Knowledg of them; as ſome by Luſt and Intemperance may ſo ſpoil their Palates, that they may not taſte the difference of Meats and Drinks; yet this laſt is never the leſs natural to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; for there is a great deal of difference
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:61474:213" rendition="simple:additions"/>
between Natural and Moral Agents; natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Agents always continue the ſame, but voluntary Agents may vary in ſome things, that are Natural; eſpecially where Men have Debauch'd their Natures, and have offered great violence to themſelves: more than this, the exceptions are not ſo general, as to infringe the univerſal Conſent of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; the difference is but in few things, and therefore they are taken notice of, and being collected together in Hiſtory they may ſeem a great many; but that they are particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly noted, is a ſign, they are but few; what if one Philoſopher mentioned, that Snow was Black, and Ten more had been of his Mind; this would have been no objection againſt the Senſe or Reaſon of Mankind; for all Men agree, that Self-preſervation is a natural Inſtinct; notwithſtanding ſome particular Perſons have offered violence to their own Lives: As to Superſtition or Idolatry, there hath been no ſuch agreement of Mankind in that, as to prove it to have a Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Nature; for it is confeſſed, that it was not always practiſed in the World; but that it had a Beginning; and indeed it grew up by degrees and ſprang out of the Corruptions of Mankind; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Time was, when there was no ſuch thing; ſo that it does not owe its Riſe to
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:61474:213"/>
Nature, but to the defection of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: For while Idolatry prevailed in the World, it was condemned by ſeveral Men, as a ſtupid and ſottiſh Thing; tho they had not the courage to declare againſt the Practice of it; ſo that whilſt it was uſed by the generality of the World, it was cenſured as a great Folly, by thoſe, that were <hi>beſt able to judg.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, WE know what is <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Vice,</hi> Good and Evil, more diſtinctly,<note place="margin">Outward Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers to us, what is Virtue and what is Vice.</note> by <hi>outward Revelation;</hi> in former Ages of the World, God was pleaſed to reveal his Will ſeveral Ways, and more eſpecially to the Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the reſt of the World being left ſolely to the dictates of natural Light; But in the latter Ages of the World, it pleaſed God to make a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and more full Declaration of his Mind by his Son, and this Revelation is for Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance the ſame with the Law of Nature; our Saviour comprehended it under theſe two Heads, the <hi>Love of God</hi> and of our <hi>Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;</hi> the Apoſtle reduceth it to Sobriety, Righteouſneſs and Piety; for the Grace of God, that bringeth Salvation, teacheth us to deny all ungodlineſs and Worldly Luſt; and to live Soberly, Righteouſly and Godly in this preſent World; ſo that if we believe
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:61474:214" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Apoſtle, the Goſpel teacheth us the very ſame things, that Nature dictateth to Mankind; for theſe are the very Virtues, which natural Light prompt Men unto; only we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a more perfect diſcovery of them by the Goſpel; and to convince Men of the Good and Evil, that are affixed to Virtue and Vice, there are great and eternal Rewards pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to one, and endleſs Puniſhments threatned to the other; ſo that now Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind have no cloak for their Sin; their Duty being ſo clearly laid open to them; and the Rewards and Puniſhments of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Life ſo plainly revealed; all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the natural Law, and the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it through the degeneracy of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, being fully ſupplyed by the Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Goſpel: So that we may now much better ſay, than the Prophet could in his days, <hi>Mich.</hi> 6.8. <hi>He hath ſhewed thee, O Man! what is good, and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do juſtly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT as to external Revelation it is Objected, that the Scripture is very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, and gives us not ſufficient direction in Matters of <hi>Faith:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WE Anſwer, that this Objection hath no Colour of Truth in it; for if the Church

of <hi>Rome,</hi> to whom are beholden for this Objection againſt the Word of God, and who are ready upon all occaſions to quarrel with it; Yet they do not deny, but the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures are plain, as to Precepts of Life and Practice; but as to matters of Faith, they pretend its defection in, as if God had not intended to reveal, but conceal his Mind in theſe things; Indeed they have ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to pretend this, conſidering, how hard it is to find ſeveral of their Doctrines in the Scripture; but as to <hi>the moral Precepts</hi> of a good Life, they all grant, that they are clearly delivered in the holy Scripture; ſo that this Objection about the obſcurity thereof doth not lie againſt what I have been ſpeaking.</p>
               <p>THEREFORE ſeeing <hi>Moral Virtues</hi> may be plainly underſtood by <hi>Natural In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, Natural Reaſon,</hi> the <hi>conſent of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,</hi> and <hi>outward Revelation,</hi> we muſt in the next place ſee, how eaſie and pleaſant they are to be practiſed.</p>
               <p>Firſt, THEY are eaſie, becauſe we are aſſiſted in the practice of them by the Holy Spirit of God, againſt all difficulties what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>
               <p>Secondly, THEY are both eaſie and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, becauſe they are profitable for all

               <p>BUT we profeſs to believe, that the Judg of all the World will do right, and if we do this, we muſt underſtand, that there will be nothing in God's proceedings at the day of Judgment, that will then be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:61474:218"/>
unjuſt by the Sons of Men; for it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, that we ſhould conceive any other Notion of Juſtice in God, than what is owned for <hi>juſt</hi> among Men;<note place="margin">What is juſt in Man, is juſt in God.</note> were it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, God would not appeal to Men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Equality of his Ways; for if the ſame Notion of Juſtice be not in God, as is in Men; we know not what it is, that is juſt in God, neither can we judg concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Equality or the Juſtice of his Proceedings: upon this account it is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Heathen to whom the Goſpel of Chriſt never came, ſhall not be condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for their unbelief; it being unjuſt to condemn men for not believing that, which was never propoſed to them for their Faith; this would be, to oblige men to things, that are impoſſible, which no Law nor Equity can do: But far be it from us to entertain any thoughts unworthy of God, or to ſay that of the beſt Being, which we would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count a reproach to our ſelves: Since then the Grace of God hath brought Salvation to us, it is our own fault, if we fall ſhort of it, and our own Conſciences will accuſe us as unworthy of Eternal Life, becauſe God hath done his part, if we be negligent in doing ours: For the <hi>Scripture</hi> attributes to <hi>us</hi> That, <hi>which God does,</hi> and <hi>bids us do

That,</hi> which God <hi>did with</hi> us, and That, <hi>which we do,</hi> is <hi>attributed to</hi> God, and <hi>That,</hi> which <hi>God does by</hi> us, is <hi>aſcribed both to God</hi> and us; we <hi>work,</hi> and <hi>God works,</hi> by whom we are awakened, directed, aſſiſted: The Controverſies are very hot, and very long, and intricate about theſe things; but I think, a right ſtating the matter, would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh them from being in the World.</p>
               <p>SINCE that Grace,<note place="margin">Grace ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation is afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us.</note> which is neceſſary to Salvation, is afforded us, we cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend any diſcouragement, but have all the reaſon in the World to ſet our hands to this Work, and to be doing our Duty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord is with us; and he hath ſaid, <hi>we ſhall not be tempted above what we are able to bear:</hi> we ſhall have ſuch an inward aſſiſtance of the Spirit of God, as is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to receive and help the weakneſs of our Natures, and that impotency, which Men generally contract by vicious Habits; and this Grace of God goes along with the external Revelation of the Goſpel, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies all thoſe, who by their wilful reſiſting and oppoſing it, have not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked God to withdraw it from them; and then we make uſe of this Grace, when we are careful to enquire into this Revelation, and do what we can to act accordingly.
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:61474:219"/>
And as our Minds are enlightned by it, ſo our Wills and Affections are warmed to a complyance therewith; we ſhall find a gentle heat in our Hearts, inclining us to a ready Obedience to the Precepts of Gods Word, and to live in all Godlineſs, as it requires; for when a Man is diſpoſed to the Practice of Virtue, he hath juſt reaſon to conclude, that the Spirit of God is at Work upon him: Therefore we ought to go on in a good courſe of Life, becauſe our work will be <hi>eaſier</hi> to us, the difficulties of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion will ſtill grow leſs, becauſe our ſtrength will encreaſe, and God hath promiſed to give greater degrees of aſſiſtance to them, <hi>who uſe,</hi>

               <p>Secondly, THE Practice of Moral Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues is both eaſie and pleaſant, becauſe they are profitable for all things, improve our Underſtandings and bring Peace to our Minds: Now Profit and Advantage have a ſtronger influence upon the affections of Mankind, than any thing elſe; if then we can reconcile Virtue with the Intereſts nnd Profits of Men, they maybe perſwaded to embrace a virtuous Courſe of Life; which doth much conduce to our Health, not only in a <hi>Spiritual,</hi> but <hi>Natural Senſe,</hi> becauſe vicious Courſes in the Nature and Tendency of them, do deſtroy the Conſtitution of
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:61474:219"/>
our Bodies: But Religion doth oblige us to the exerciſe of ſuch particular Virtues, as do as naturally tend to our Welfare and Long-Life; for Diſeaſes are prevented by living abſtemiouſly, and the firm Eſtate of the Body depends upon Chaſtity; the quiet both of Mind and Body too, upon the moderation of our Paſſions; whereas the Luſtful waſte and conſume away, becauſe they follow <hi>Harlots, till a Dart ſtrikes through their Livers;</hi> Now the great tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph of Senſuality is, where the Ear is fed with Muſick, the Eye with Beauty, the Smell with Perfumes, the Taſte with Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets; what a Tumult do theſe various Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects raiſe within Men! What Feavers do they kindle in their Blood, by their delicious Meats, as well as by Wines and Strong Drinks!</p>
               <p>BUT Virtue doth not only eſtabliſh Mens Health, but increaſes their Eſtates alſo;<note place="margin">Virtue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhes our health and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments our eſtates.</note> therefore the Wiſe-man hath placed in her left Hand Riches; which is brought to paſs by charging Men to be Faithful and True, diligent and induſtrious in their Callings: For as Study and Experience give more force to the Soul, than any diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whatever of the Body; ſo Induſtry and Intention of Mind apon Buſineſs, will ſuſtain a Man in every Eſtate, hath an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence

<pb n="391" facs="tcp:61474:221"/>
by delivering us from the power of all Paſſions whatſoever; which is done by <hi>regulating the Imagination,</hi> whence they aroſe; that is, by ſubjecting it to Reaſon, that it may not without <hi>Conſultation</hi> follow the <hi>Suggeſtions of Senſe,</hi> and unruly <hi>Motions of Appetite;</hi> theſe being the Clouds that darken the Mind by a kind of <hi>Phyſical and Natural Influence:</hi> For as Intemperance and Exceſs do embaſe and clog our Minds, and glue them to the World, ſo they indiſpoſe them for all the Operations of the Spirit; Malice, Wrath, and Envy, fill us with Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice and falſe Apprehenſions of things; ſo that Mens Spirits under theſe Diſtempers are not pure, nor fine enough for their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; for as Clearneſs diſpoſeth the bodily Eye for a better and quicker ſight of material Objects; ſo the Purity of our Souls, that is, freedom from Luſt and Paſſion, fit us for Acts of Reaſon and Underſtanding.

ſo on the contrary, the chief part of the Miſery of ungodly Men is this, that they are of a Temper which is naturally a diſquiet to it ſelf; and here the foundation of Hell is laid in the evil frame and diſpoſition of their own Spirits; when Men are not cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect in their Converſation, and very careful to walk in the ways of Godlineſs, eſpecially when the Confines of Vertue and Vice are ſo cloſe, and the exact Limits and Boundaries are ſo difficultly fixed: Until this raſh and inconſiderate running into Vice be cured, which only can be done by the practice of Virtue, it is as impoſſible that a Man ſhould he happy or pleaſed, as for a ſick Man to find eaſe by removing from one Bed to another, becauſe the Diſtemper is lodged within his Breaſt; all the Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of which muſt be quieted before we can be happy, for Happineſs muſt be in our Hearts, and it muſt ſpring out of our own boſoms, and from thence, thro the comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table influence of God's Holy Spirit, muſt all our Peace and Pleaſure flow.

               <p>Fourthly, WE ſee in the laſt place, what is the beſt way to appeaſe the wrath of God, and to reconcile our ſelves to him; God ſeems oftentimes to have a Controverſie with us, as with his People of old; and at ſuch times we are apt to ask, as they did, <hi>wherewith ſhall we come before the Lord, and bow our ſelves before the moſt high God!</hi> And we are apt to think, as they did, that the next way to pleaſe him is by <hi>external Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Devotion,</hi> which may be good and neceſſary; but theſe are not the things that God doth mainly require of us: it is true, <hi>Prayers, hearing the Word of God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Sacraments</hi> are to be performed; but theſe are but means to a further End, and ſerve to engage us to the practice of the <hi>great and eſſential Duties of Chriſtianity,</hi> and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Virtues of a good Life: There doth appear in many Men a great deal of external Devotion, but their Lives and Manners are generally very corrupt, and the <hi>weighty things of the Law are neglected,</hi> as Juſtice, Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and Mercy; ſo that we may take up the complaint of the Royal Pſalmiſt,

Thus it is in Nature, we ſee the Sun ſhine, and can feel his warmth, but we diſcern not how he enters into the Bowels of the Earth; how his little Atoms ſteal into the ſecret Pores of Plants; how he impregnates Nature with new Life; nay we feel not, how our own Spirits move, how they ſtart and flie, as quick, as we think, from one end of our Nerves to the other, ſo undiſcernable, and ſo puiſſant is the working of God's Grace in the change of our Minds into an heavenly Temper, in imprinting upon our Souls the fair and lovely Notions of Goodneſs and
